0,6900644,"Minhaj's recent turn at the Correspondent's Dinner made me check out this special, although I was wondering if he would simply be taking political shots, which at the moment is very much like shooting fish in a barrel. Before seeing him in this special I had quite liked him as a correspondent on The Daily Show, even if he didn't manage to break out of the shadow of some better than him – plus if memory serves me, he came in at the end of Stewart's time, which was not long before I stopped being a regular viewer. All that said, I was surprised by how much and how consistently I enjoyed this special.Delivered in his hometown, Minhaj has constructed a personal show that moves through a lot of ground, that serves as somewhat of an emotional roller-coaster, puts a lot of issues on the table, but remains consistently accessible and funny for those such as myself who do not have this frame of reference. Minhaj's timing and polish is of a very high standard, and he makes the show feel really professional and slick, but still keeps that sense of it being an honest performance with freshness and emotion. And it is a 'performance' more than a normal stand-up show. He moves around the stage well, and items such as screens and lighting are well timed around his performance. In the context of a filmed special, I also enjoyed the camera-work, as it knew how to move around him, when to go close etc – it was very well filmed and edited.Main thing though is that it engages and is funny throughout.

3,6900644,"1 star might be a bit harsh, but, this had a 9.3 when I wrote this. I am now sure Netflix must make people create new accounts to give their material good reviews. Hasan does not seem like a bad person, but, this show sucks. It is basically just his life story. He is only 31. In summary; 1. his parents are from India. 2. they moved to the USA 3. they are very strict and have high expectations 4. he has a younger sister 5. Jocks at school were jerks 6. After 911 his family received a threatening phone call and their car was vandalised 7. He dated a white girl 8. He married a Hindu girl and he is Muslim. I had to stop here. 2/3's in and I can't take any more. I feel some sympathy. It must be tough being the only family in your area with dark skin and racists who commit crimes should be charged. However, the reason I give this such a low rating is It is not at all funny. Sure he peppers some jokes in here and there, but, there is far too much vanity for my taste. To think your life is so interesting it warrants a 90 minute public presentation, you'd better be James Bond to get away with it. Even then, that would not be stand up comedy. Take someone like Russell Peters. He is a Canadian with Indian parents. He tells stories from his life sometimes, but, they are hilarious. Peters is a master of accents and subtly good as a physical comedian. Also, with Peters the story is always in service of telling a joke and not the other way around. This guy just tells boring stories about his life in equally boring ways and every so often slips in some virtue signalling; 'I think racism is bad', everyone cheers. He never quite says that, but, you get my point. Everyone knows racism is bad, now where are the jokes?

He is deep and insightful, able to focus on the little things that go unnoticed but that do matter so much. The flow of the show is impeccable, he goes from being emotional and almost philosophical to being funny just at the right moments, and he keeps you in the constant state of anticipation and curiosity. You don't feel like it's a comedy special you're watching. No, it feels like a good friend is telling you an amazingly interesting story, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always leaving you wanting more. And, most importantly, even though I don't agree with some of the stuff he says, I could relate to the things he was talking about. This lifted this show to a level much higher than a comedy special.

And just when he gets you roaring with laughter, he'll turn the joke on you, and apologize for your lack of decency in laughing at the terrible things he's saying.As his stand-up is quite the opposite of clean and family friendly, it's obvious that some imbeciles will always take offense.

It seems like everyone was introduced to him through that special and then that led people to want to see what else was available and sadly there wasn't much. Patrice would die not too long after these two specials were made and it's a real shame because they both prove what a major talent he was and sadly it was taking away much too early. The film certainly lives up to its title because O'Neal goes after everything from race to harassment to sexual diseases and even goes after the people in the crowd. The going after the crowd is something that many great and bad comedians have went for but I must say that I've never seen anyone as great as O'Neal. It's always a tricky subject because the comedian can't come off too cruel because he'd lose the crowd and it really is just amazing to see O'Neal work the crowd, have fun with them and never lose them. Just watch the way how he'll start off a topic, get a few cracks about himself in and then head out to the crowd to make fun of a few people and bring them in on the joke. Even better is how O'Neal can take what they say and then run with it in a whole new direction. There are countless hilarious moments to be found here but my personal favorite was probably the bit dealing with harassment and why there should be a day each year when men can say what they want to women without going to HR.

155,1625345,"Patrice O'Neal, just like Greg Giraldo who died in September 2010, is a comedian that never got his proper fame. And now, it is unlikely he ever will. O'Neal died on November 29, 2011 from complications from a stroke he suffered in mid-October due to his diabetes. For his entire life he struggled with weight-management and diabetes. Elephant in the Room was his first, and only, comedy special he ever made.What made Patrice O'Neal so unique was his spontaneous delivery. He referred to his specials as ""conversational,"" and not of a typical breed. You can tell from Elephant in the Room that, while some skits were written, many jokes stemmed from the audience and audience participation. Patrice encourages fans to shout out answers to his questions so he can form a punchline in an impromptu manner. I think this is what a lot of people either didn't pay attention to, or didn't realize this and that's why he never reached a respectable height in his career.If it hadn't been for his final Television appearance on The Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen, I doubt many people would even know who he was. Same with Greg Giraldo. How many people would've known him if Comedy Central didn't make his name what is was? It's a question that will never be answered, just pondered.Elephant in the Room is just what it sounds like. Patrice is referring to big issues like animal cruelty, racism, cheating, harassment, and many other issues, he feels, he needs to address. He tackles them in a way where humor comes natural, as it derives from the situation himself. Take for example when he discusses animal cruelty, a topic I really hate to bring up. It's a heartless and cruel form of abuse, like any type. Patrice doesn't poke fun at the idea, but the gratuitous, guilt-bringing commercials. Now that's funny.Of course, there are times when the special doesn't go in the proper direction. In the very beginning, Patrice gets to hung up on the topic of ""breasts"" and the idea feels tired and dreary. I would've much rather seen Patrice use those minutes to provide more of his insanely spontaneous remarks and philosophy on unsung issues. He brings such valid points to the table, especially when talking about the over-exaggerated issue of harassment.The special refrains from useless skit, which is one of the highest compliments I can give a comedy special. I hate skits. They're drab and unnecessary. Especially when it stars a comedian in costume when he/she should be on stage with a mic in their hands. Patrice devotes seventy-seven minutes to just him, the mic, and the audience. Patrice also refrains from excessive uses of the n word, a word used far too much with current black comedians. I can't recall Patrice using the word more than five or six times. Maybe he spoke so softly and fluently that it was muted, but I highly doubt it.Sadly, Patrice's career ended far too early. His death was not only saddening because he was so young, but because we all know a seventy-seven minute special obviously can't contain the weight, no pun intended, of his philosophy and wit. I think he would've been one of the many comedians who got better with age and wisdom. He almost reminds me of the later George Carlin, circa 2004 - 2007. Carlin become more philosophical in his later years rather than his very blunt, vulgar character he created in the seventies. If Patrice could form a side of maturity pretty well at the beginning of his career, imagine how greatly it could've improved with many more years of experience.Starring: Patrice O'Neal.",0,,ur23483288,2 December 2011,0,,325,237,6.286153846153846,0.7292307692307692,"('patrice', 12)('many', 6)('special', 5)('oneal', 4)('like', 4)('comedy', 4)('never', 3)('room', 3)('audience', 3)('form', 3)","['patrice', 'oneal', 'like', 'greg', 'giraldo', 'died', 'september', 'comedian', 'never', 'got', 'proper', 'fame', 'unlikely', 'ever', 'oneal', 'died', 'november', 'complications', 'stroke', 'suffered', 'midoctober', 'due', 'diabetes', 'entire', 'life', 'struggled', 'weightmanagement', 'diabetes', 'elephant', 'room', 'first', 'comedy', 'special', 'ever', 'madewhat', 'made', 'patrice', 'oneal', 'unique', 'spontaneous', 'delivery', 'referred', 'specials', 'conversational', 'typical', 'breed', 'tell', 'elephant', 'room', 'skits', 'written', 'many', 'jokes', 'stemmed', 'audience', 'audience', 'participation', 'patrice', 'encourages', 'fans', 'shout', 'answers', 'questions', 'form', 'punchline', 'impromptu', 'manner', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'either', 'didnt', 'pay', 'attention', 'didnt', 'realize', 'thats', 'never', 'reached', 'respectable', 'height', 'careerif', 'hadnt', 'final', 'television', 'appearance', 'comedy', 'central', 'roast', 'charlie', 'sheen', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'even', 'know', 'greg', 'giraldo', 'many', 'people', 'wouldve', 'known', 'comedy', 'central', 'didnt', 'make', 'name', 'question', 'never', 'answered', 'ponderedelephant', 'room', 'sounds', 'like', 'patrice', 'referring', 'big', 'issues', 'like', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'racism', 'cheating', 'harassment', 'many', 'issues', 'feels', 'needs', 'address', 'tackles', 'way', 'humor', 'comes', 'natural', 'derives', 'situation', 'take', 'example', 'discusses', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'topic', 'really', 'hate', 'bring', 'heartless', 'cruel', 'form', 'abuse', 'like', 'type', 'patrice', 'doesnt', 'poke', 'fun', 'idea', 'gratuitous', 'guiltbringing', 'commercials', 'thats', 'funnyof', 'course', 'times', 'special', 'doesnt', 'go', 'proper', 'direction', 'beginning', 'patrice', 'gets', 'hung', 'topic', 'breasts', 'idea', 'feels', 'tired', 'dreary', 'wouldve', 'much', 'rather', 'seen', 'patrice', 'use', 'minutes', 'provide', 'insanely', 'spontaneous', 'remarks', 'philosophy', 'unsung', 'issues', 'brings', 'valid', 'points', 'table', 'especially', 'talking', 'overexaggerated', 'issue', 'harassmentthe', 'special', 'refrains', 'useless', 'skit', 'one', 'highest', 'compliments', 'give', 'comedy', 'special', 'hate', 'skits', 'theyre', 'drab', 'unnecessary', 'especially', 'stars', 'comedian', 'costume', 'heshe', 'stage', 'mic', 'hands', 'patrice', 'devotes', 'seventyseven', 'minutes', 'mic', 'audience', 'patrice', 'also', 'refrains', 'excessive', 'uses', 'n', 'word', 'word', 'used', 'far', 'much', 'current', 'black', 'comedians', 'cant', 'recall', 'patrice', 'using', 'word', 'five', 'six', 'times', 'maybe', 'spoke', 'softly', 'fluently', 'muted', 'highly', 'doubt', 'itsadly', 'patrices', 'career', 'ended', 'far', 'early', 'death', 'saddening', 'young', 'know', 'seventyseven', 'minute', 'special', 'obviously', 'cant', 'contain', 'weight', 'pun', 'intended', 'philosophy', 'wit', 'think', 'wouldve', 'one', 'many', 'comedians', 'got', 'better', 'age', 'wisdom', 'almost', 'reminds', 'later', 'george', 'carlin', 'circa', 'carlin', 'become', 'philosophical', 'later', 'years', 'rather', 'blunt', 'vulgar', 'character', 'created', 'seventies', 'patrice', 'could', 'form', 'side', 'maturity', 'pretty', 'well', 'beginning', 'career', 'imagine', 'greatly', 'couldve', 'improved', 'many', 'years', 'experiencestarring', 'patrice', 'oneal']"

158,1625345,"I'm not going to go into a full review on this special because it's already been done by others. Several reviewers have said that Charlie Sheen's roast introduced Patrice to the world. That's just flat wrong. That honor belongs to Opie & Anthony and Colin Quinn. O&A's popular syndicated FM radio show in the late 90s/early 2000s, had Patrice on and he quickly became a regular guest and co-host. He even hosted his own radio show on their XM channel. This is the place where Patrice told his hilarious stories including his brief stint in jail after being falsely accused of rape at 16, being propositioned by a guy at a rest area who knocked on his car window with the pickup line ""it's cold out here,"" and who can forget his tales of working girls in Brazil and the suitcase of glass toys? For anyone seeking more Patrice, I highly recommend finding his radio appearances on O&A (there are many clips on YouTube). This is where you'll hear ""Patrikey"" giving his take on the news, interviewing celebrities, and interacting with other comics including Chris Rock, Louis CK, and Bill Burr. He even discusses the behind the scenes of the Charlie Sheen roast. This was a very popular show for awhile on FM radio and XM for almost 20 years. Patrice is a big part of the reason why. This is probably what led to his getting the VH-1 hosting gig.In addition to O&A, Patrice was also a regular comic on Tough Crowd, hosted by Colin Quinn on Comedy Central in the early 2000s. It was a show that allowed popular comics to riff on the news and rip on each other. Patrice was absolutely hilarious on it. Clips are also available on YT.For fans of comedy, O&A and Tough Crowd were the real reason Patrice was exposed to the world and probably the reason he was even asked to the roast. Both O&A and Tough Crowd were national shows, not some niche shows that were tough to find. His exposure on these shows gave him the heat he needed to be able to obtain parts in films and TV and almost certainly caught the attention of HBO and Comedy Central which led to his two specials. The people from these shows are the same people who hold an annual fundraiser raising money for Patrice's family who he supported financially.

It's nothing political but instead this is just an incredibly unfunny and extremely flat comedy special.The majority of the 57-minute running time are the same type of jokes done over and over. Of course, these jokes include Schumer talking about her vagina and various body fluids as well as various poop stories. I have nothing against that type of subject matter but it's just not funny here. In fact, I honestly only laughed two times during this special and that's just not good at all.I'm not going to judge Schumer by this one performance. I'm not sure what your typical routine is as this is the first one I've seen but I just didn't find the material to be all that funny and the delivery wasn't any better.",0,,ur13134536,27 March 2017,0,,112,92,5.839285714285714,0.8214285714285714,"('schumer', 5)('special', 4)('political', 3)('leather', 2)('course', 2)('really', 2)('dont', 2)('flat', 2)('nothing', 2)('type', 2)","['amy', 'schumer', 'leather', 'special', 'schumer', 'netflix', 'special', 'center', 'controversy', 'due', 'low', 'scores', 'schumer', 'blames', 'certain', 'types', 'liking', 'film', 'course', 'led', 'political', 'battle', 'really', 'neededi', 'personally', 'dont', 'care', 'political', 'stands', 'celebrity', 'wants', 'make', 'id', 'never', 'shallow', 'enough', 'bash', 'work', 'dont', 'believe', 'politics', 'said', 'leather', 'special', 'flat', 'awful', 'theres', 'really', 'way', 'around', 'nothing', 'political', 'instead', 'incredibly', 'unfunny', 'extremely', 'flat', 'comedy', 'specialthe', 'majority', 'running', 'time', 'type', 'jokes', 'done', 'course', 'jokes', 'include', 'schumer', 'talking', 'vagina', 'various', 'body', 'fluids', 'well', 'various', 'poop', 'stories', 'nothing', 'type', 'subject', 'matter', 'funny', 'fact', 'honestly', 'laughed', 'two', 'times', 'special', 'thats', 'good', 'allim', 'going', 'judge', 'schumer', 'one', 'performance', 'im', 'sure', 'typical', 'routine', 'first', 'one', 'ive', 'seen', 'didnt', 'find', 'material', 'funny', 'delivery', 'wasnt', 'better']"

That she talks alot about sex is not a problem, that's what she's known for, but it wasn't just as funny as her Live At The Apollo show.

190,6616074,"This review is going to be short and sweet because, to be completely honest, I don't have much experience in judging comedy specials. Usually, standup comedy isn't really ""my thing"", but if something catches my eye I'll watch from time to time.A few years back, I watched what I think was Amy Schumer's first comedy routine to be put to film, and I remember thinking it was hilarious. She isn't for everyone, but I'm not too prudish when it comes to humor, so I enjoyed it.As such, I saw this ""Leather Special"" and decided to give it a try. What I found, unfortunately, is that it didn't make me chuckle more than a couple of times in an hour. Her previous satire of male/female relationships has seemingly now turned into all raunchy sex comedy. Like I said, I realize that approach has its place, but all humor needs to have some heart/truth behind it to work. This one most certainly does not have either.So, my final verdict is that ""Leather Special"" can easily be skipped even if you are a Schumer fan.

192,6616074,"Rolling onto a Denver stage evoking the Michelin Man comedienne Amy Schumer goes flat in no time with abrasive material and a fatigued delivery that fails to string enough funny jokes together to get the auditorium completely on her side for an extended period anywhere throughout the concert. The self deprecating Ms.Schumer, shoved sausage like in a leather boy outfit does her routine no favors with the style choice that harvests a couple of jokes early but once exhausted leaves us with an inner tube on stage lecturing on BJs and pussy, likening hers to a barnyard animal, albeit a small one she amends.Vulgar, crude, smug Schumer does take a sober time out to address her gun stance as she combines a brief memento mori and cheap shot at gun owner yahoos before returning to her wheelhouse of gross, the stage lights taking their toll on her buttery face giving her a Rodney Dangerfield glow.The Leather Show is a slap dash mess of material and delivery featuring a popular comedienne in free fall. It reminds me of Robin Williams last stand-up when he was desperate and over the hill relying on heavy handed crassness to get him through the show. Williams had an excuse, Schumer, supposedly in her prime, relying heavily on below the waist humor has clearly taken a career hit with this abysmal showing. An ideal comedy side kick she could have made a fine career as a Zasu Pitts, Eve Arden or Marie Provost type but as far as a top billed comic or leading lady she has been hyped into mediocrity and the quiet niche of success she more than likely would have carved out as a supporting player will be long gone after her latest comedy with Hawn fails to ignite and the Barbie experiment bombs bigger than this putrid Special.

193,6616074,"You know you'd think an artist and their material would improve with time and experience. Well that just did not happen with this Amy Schumer stand up special. I'll start out by saying that I really do like Amy Schumer, I've seen her previous stand up comedy and I was doubled over crying laughing during all of them, and she quickly became one of my favorite and most watched comedians. That being said, the leather special just didn't work that well overall. I laughed a total of 4 times during this hour long comedy special. Amy is still as likable as she has been in her previous routines but the problem is that the majority of the content here is recycled and more of the same old stuff that she's done many times before. I enjoy the topics she covers usually, being able to pick fun at herself and tell funny jokes and stories about her own life. I love that, but the material she used here just didn't have that special hilarious Amy Schumer vibe to it like the ones from the past did. I will say that there are 3 or 4 funny jokes in the show and I also applaud Schumer's mentioning of two innocent women going to see her movie and getting shot. I applaud that because she got involved in the gun violence problem and is raising awareness to end the gun violence epidemic. I also appreciate her very positive messages of loving yourself and your body. Being comfortable in your own skin. 4/10. I REALLY hope Snatched is good, can't wait to go see it.

194,6616074,"Here are a few reasons why you probably won't like this Netflix TV offering... 1 - You're a man. 2 - Her politics. 3 - You're weary of being instructed that these fashionable female comics are funny by people who are out of step with what most people find funny. 4 - She promised to move abroad and then changed her mind. 5 - She's deliberately unsightly to look at. (I'm assuming it's deliberate.)I've never seen any of her other work so I have nothing to compare this with... and I only watched this because I read that it was so spectacularly bad, I wanted to see for myself.She could have been forgiven for her politics if only she was creative and funny.

Then she started getting unnecessarily political in her interviews which I really hate to see celebrities do. And then came this ""special"". And my god, what a ""special"" it was. Now, I know not every set a comedian does will always be a home run. But if you're gonna have an entire special on a popular streaming app like Netflix, at least take the time to make sure the material is at least somewhat good. This special was anything but good. The jokes were just not funny and many times unnecessarily vulgar and crude, which I usually don't mind, as long as it's ACTUALLY FUNNY!

203,6616074,"I have a confession, I couldn't finish it. After sticking with it for 30-40 minutes I brushed the remote and saw there was another twenty minutes to go and just lost heart. And listening to her audience, it was a luxury that they surely missed. There are bad audiences but this must have been agonizing for her, there is so little reaction to her punchlines I can only wonder how empty the house was. And what little laughter she got is suspect as well, it doesn't feel natural. There is a short period of silence between her punch line and what little applause she does receive, and these aren't brain teasers, and the laughter she gets is short and subdued as though they are trying to fill in the awkward silence until she moves on.The problem may be that the material wasn't suitable for this audience but that is hardly an excuse. Instead of trying to mix up her routine and seeing what works, she sticks to her guns and continues with the same band of humor for the vast majority of the show. Its just dirty joke after dirty joke from a comedian without much versatility. If you go in not wanting to hear about the scent of her vagina, you are in for a very long night. This may also be to her detriment, she has been around for a while now but this show doesn't show much growth in her stand up. Its equally likely that her shtick is getting played out.The lack of variety also has one more major problem for her routine. It all begins to sound the same. Her jokes start to run together until it is almost impossible to tell where one joke ends and the next begins.

We keep looking as long as we can to maybe get a glimpse of gore. There is no gore here. As other reviewers have accurately detailed, this is a super unentertaining show on every imaginable level. I paused it at about the 40 minute mark thinking she was just getting warmed up. Unfortunately, it only had 12 minutes to go. Amy is dressed in a truly awful tight leather outfit. By the way, I don't care about fat or overweight or body type or whatever. I think all women are awesome no matter their shape or weight. But this outfit is just so distracting and misplaced. Was the outfit funny? No. Retro? No. Sexy? No. Flattering? No. It's just tight-fitting, very poorly designed, and bad. You'll have a hard time keeping your eyes on her face instead of her distended belly under the skin tight leather. OK, enough on the outfit already! The show is unlike any other performance of hers I have seen. The one word that came to mind as the credits rolled was ""Lazy."" This was exceedingly lazy writing and preparation, combined with an even more exceedingly lazy performance. She talks a lot about how bad her vagina smells and gives extreme details about her diarrhea. Her transitions between subjects are very stilted and unnatural. It was almost like she wanted to get to something important and was biding her time. And guess what? She was! Without warning, she made a hard transition from talking about how she has to make a ""hand shelf"" after her boyfriend does his ""business"" on her breasts (not funny, really poor delivery), to the two women who were shot and killed during a viewing of her movie ""Train Wreck."" She then spends an inordinate amount of time talking about restricting gun rights for certain classes of people. No problem with this. But she then gets into blind gun owners and other things where she seems to completely lose the audience. Tough to get back to humor after that but she tries - and fails. Then the show is over.She was paid a minimum of $11,000,000 for the show and some say more. Wow.

207,6616074,"I have never been a fan of Amy Schumer's politics or personal life choices, but despite the way that so many skeptical and/or anti-SJW people have become lately (with attempts to boycott or abandon anything even remotely associated with cultural Marxism), I have never had problems separating a person's art/work/product/service with their personal ideology. I enjoy watching a variety of opinions on every subject in an attempt to come to the closest objective truth to any issue, so I will be discounting most of the political content here as material better tailored towards a different audience.Despite the hate train most have been on with Amy Schumer and her contemporaries (and it's admittedly easy to see why, especially when considering the way she treats her fans and her peers), I was always a fan of her stand-up and really enjoyed watching her show. While I will admit that some material in her show may have been plagiarized by her writing staff, I honestly highly doubt it in most cases (nor do I particularly care to be honest). I feel like this special, continuing a long drought in her career when combined with her recent appearances and media presence, really serves to exemplify just how disconnected with reality Amy Schumer has become. She has become incapable of admitting to doing anything wrong and by her own admission sees any and all criticism as resulting from a controlled propaganda arm designed to tank her career. Honestly, she's doing a great job of it all by herself. I expected this to be a more politically charged version of her older content, but her older style is absent. The writing is completely different. The delivery is abysmal. The punch-lines are almost non-existent. You would think a sold-out arena with paid fluff-er's in the audience (a common practice for stand-up specials) would be roaring with laughter the whole time, but it wasn't. Even they didn't know when to laugh. And if a paid fluff-er can't tell, how is anyone else supposed to?Spoilers: It starts with a rather unceremonious reference to Eddy Murphy's ""Raw"" special. She doesn't specifically compare herself to Murphy, but it is quite obviously an attempt to do so. If that doesn't sit right with you, add that to her assertions that she is the first female comic to play arenas (later changed to ""continuously selling out arenas""), a rather enormous slam against other successful female comics, and you can easily see the tone of the entire piece already. Amy Schumer is better than you, but still feels horrible, so she regularly gets blackout drunk and binge eats junk food. That is essentially her entire act in a nutshell. Now this could be worked into a great comedy special; plenty of other comics have found success addressing these topics, but Amy's writing falls flat. It is very apparent how nervous she is on stage the entire time, and the entire performance suffers as a result. Sometimes she is too quiet, others too loud; sometimes she doesn't allow for proper pausing, and other times she hangs on far too long. It honestly strikes me as if she has either had far too much or too little to drink beforehand. But even if her performance of the material (as it is written) were perfect, it is still difficult to see it as being funny. The good bits in her material aren't fleshed out nearly enough, and aren't placed evenly throughout enough to give the viewer any reason to continue watching (I had given up the first time 20 minutes in and later forced myself to finish). It is very clear that if there was a period where she understood her own sense of humor, that she simply doesn't anymore. This seems like an awkward transition set rather than a full- fledged recording; wherein the artist wants to go in a new direction but still somehow retain their old audience. Instead of admitting to bombing her Netflix special, she has chosen to blame Trump, anti-feminists, and internet trolls for her poor ratings, creating such a stir that Netflix is in the process of replacing their existing 5- star ratings system with like/dislike buttons. If I had any respect for her as a person or craftsman, I don't any longer. She needs to grow up and realize that not everything she touches will turn to gold, that even her most ardent fans won't always give her perfect scores, and that all comics experience rises and plateaus in their careers. If she can manage to come to terms with that, I suspect her entire worldview will change, and she can start making entertaining content once more. Respect is earned, not given. Media is by and large a meritocracy, not a glorified nepotistic circle-jerk (excluding award shows). She can continue down this road into squalor and abject obscurity, manufacturing scandals to try and remain relevant, or she can go back to square one and rediscover what is funny to her-- what was funny to her audience. Maybe she'll decide that those two things have become entirely separate entities. Regardless, I hope that she fixes some of her personal problems, scales back the drinking a bit, and rebuilds her career. Not simply as Amy Schumer: the woman held back from greatness by the patriarchy, but as Amy Schumer: the person.",0,,ur66261131,27 March 2017,0,,461,364,6.440347071583514,0.789587852494577,"('amy',

216,0249854,"This is George's first HBO Special from 1977 - ""On Location with George Carlin""... his earliest concert performance available on video. He is playful from the very start. Even before he has spoken, he tries to get laughs from the mic lead. He doesn't seem completely comfortable, and talks about being nervous - which seem quite genuine. A new phase of his career is starting... after the age of 40! He begins as gently as he can, with observations of shared modern life. The comedy of common experience. Stuff he's done on his albums, which he knows is reliable, and very audience-friendly. He clearly feels the need to get off to a solid start. He tries so hard to be visually funny that his mimes are probably too exaggerated, and to me sometimes distract from the material. Not everything he does works, but the encouraging audience lets him miss a few times as long as keeps trying to come back with another hit.Unfortunately, some of the observations seem inane to me in 2005. Dogs and cats! I ask you. I suppose it's not his fault that subject has been done to death since then... to such a degree to make that a comedy cliché in itself. In the middle of the show, George takes time out to do his contrived news items - showing his mastery of set-up punchline jokes.What George Carlin also does that no other comedian has done to such a degree is to analyse language. Not just phrases, but individual words. And things like oxymorons (look it up if you don't know what it means!). The stuff that flies by in our daily lives, that we all accept without thinking about it. There in practiser we have a principle that George talks about when describing how to create comedy - ""Anything we ALL know about, nut NEVER talk about... is FUNNY.""

That's why people walk out of comedy shows like Dougs - because they think it's just entertainment. They think it is like switching on a sit-com, they want to switch their brains off and just watch and laugh at the bits with the canned laughter. This kind of comedy wont stoop to that level.

When you hear the song you can't help but think of somebody you've met who fit the lyrics to a T - and who can forget them?Cause I'm a liar, yeah, I'm a liar I'll tear your mind out, I'll burn your soul I'll turn you into me, I'll turn you into me 'Cause I'm a liar, a liar, a liar, a liar, a liar.. (Maniacal laughter)Despite having been around on the fringes of, well, everything for over 30 years, Rollins has not lost any of the steam that made him relevant - and if anything he seems to be gathering momentum yet again. Other recent appearances (""Portlandia"") highlight Rollins' chameleon-like ability to create his own niche nearly effortlessly and this show is one more example. In this one-man show/documentary/comedy special/? we hear Henry's sometimes startling stories and observations on his life, his music, his opinions, strange experiences he has had and plenty more. Henry is the rare kind of musician that defies categorization; but if you're familiar with Rollins - and especially if you're not - this Showtime documentary is probably worth a look. It's a peek into the mind of one of the most amazing, prolific, and yet little-known personalities in show business.",0,,ur45879942,11 August 2018,0,1.0,179,142,6.072625698324022,0.7932960893854749,"('liar', 8)('rollins', 6)('ill', 4)('henry', 3)('seems', 3)('tv', 3)('im', 3)('around', 2)('everything', 2)('media', 2)","['rollins', 'real', 'name', 'henry', 'lawrence', 'garfield', 'around', 'decades', 'seems', 'done', 'everything', 'point', 'starting', 'punk', 'rocker', 'quickly', 'branched', 'every', 'aspect', 'media', 'owner', 'record', 'label', 'black', 'flag', 'radio', 'tv', 'host', 'tv', 'movie', 'actor', 'appeared', 'movies', 'countless', 'tv', 'shows', 'voiceover', 'artist', 'author', 'half', 'dozen', 'books', 'seems', 'nothing', 'media', 'rollins', 'cant', 'hasnt', 'relationship', 'since', 'choice', 'voluntarily', 'childless', 'fronting', 'henry', 'rollins', 'band', 'memorable', 'odd', 'years', 'ago', 'video', 'beavis', 'butthead', 'performing', 'oddly', 'creepyfunny', 'song', 'liar', 'b', 'b', 'provide', 'narration', 'hear', 'song', 'cant', 'help', 'think', 'somebody', 'youve', 'met', 'fit', 'lyrics', 'forget', 'themcause', 'im', 'liar', 'yeah', 'im', 'liar', 'ill', 'tear', 'mind', 'ill', 'burn', 'soul', 'ill', 'turn', 'ill', 'turn', 'cause', 'im', 'liar', 'liar', 'liar', 'liar', 'liar', 'maniacal', 'laughterdespite', 'around', 'fringes', 'well', 'everything', 'years', 'rollins', 'lost', 'steam', 'made', 'relevant', 'anything', 'seems', 'gathering', 'momentum', 'yet', 'recent', 'appearances', 'portlandia', 'highlight', 'rollins', 'chameleonlike', 'ability', 'create', 'niche', 'nearly', 'effortlessly', 'show', 'one', 'example', 'oneman', 'showdocumentarycomedy', 'special', 'hear', 'henrys', 'sometimes', 'startling', 'stories', 'observations', 'life', 'music', 'opinions', 'strange', 'experiences', 'plenty', 'henry', 'rare', 'kind', 'musician', 'defies', 'categorization', 'youre', 'familiar', 'rollins', 'especially', 'youre', 'showtime', 'documentary', 'probably', 'worth', 'look', 'peek', 'mind', 'one', 'amazing', 'prolific', 'yet', 'littleknown', 'personalities', 'show', 'business']"

224,8241704,"Keep talking, pal, is right. Henry Rollins' mind fascinates me. He is uber intelligent, and I am mesmerized by his rapid-fire, captivating, storytelling approach. He shows vulnerability by showing us his raw truth. He is an expert speaker, going quickly, keeping our attention fixed on his words, lest we lose something, but he also clearly articulates, and allows just enough time for our own processing to occur. If you enjoy mental stimulation, I highly recommend viewing this talk.As far as humor, his style draws laughter out of me with a start. My mind is processing what he is saying, so quickly, that the laugh bursts forth before I even realize it's coming. It is a wonderful feeling.Lately, I've been feeling a bit old and tired too, and I truly believe that it is time for the young, energetic people to take up the torch. My main take away is that we can and we must still stand: stand for them, stand behind them, stand with them. Generation X opened the path wider, and now they will see it through to the next level. After watching this, I will remember to support the torch bearers more loudly. It IS exciting to see what changes they will affect in my lifetime!To the reviewers that are shocked by Henry Rollins' words. I saw him speak, well over a decade ago, maybe two, and he was just as open-minded, supportive of diversity, and loud in his support of equal rights for ALL people.

Madigan also had some things to say about a recent USO tour of Afghanistan entertaining our troops there, giving them all the credit they deserved for working in an environment that was like being frozen and having sand thrown in your face. Tackling a variety of subjects, Madigan explores her experiences at the gym, on cruise ships, and how the country might have reacted if Twitter were around during the Revolutionary War - 'The British are coming, the British are coming'.

From the beginning of his act, he endears himself to his audience through a series of admissions to inadequacies as a parent, a spouse, a fighter and lover. Everyone in the audience could identify with him, as the material was fresh and very relevant.And, all of the things he rants about, happens to all of us in one way or the other. Many comedians use the family unit and it's idiosyncrasies as a vehicle for their guffaws, but few have implemented this tool with such finesse and relentlessness. Kevin mentions his uncle who'd spent fifteen years in prison and was institutionalized to the point that everything he talked about came from a prison mentality-barking at kevin to 'say it with yer chest' ( or add some bass to your voice) and calling on kev to jump in and whoop someone's butt in a bar as if he were ordering a gang hit. the delivery was razor sharp, and the familiarity of the subject rang true. excessively funny. Kevin goes on to bash on his wife for spoiling his gangsta-style intimidation moves in public. He relates that even if he were a passive person and not violent at all, that was THEIR business. in this spiel, kev threatens to go 'pop the trunk' and retrieve a gun and 'shoot this s**t up' while his wife says 'what are you going to get out of the trunk, the carseat?'. What guy hasn't had some version of that play itself out in their lives? relevant. Sharp. Hilarious.

It was laden with presumptuous racism that assumes the audience agrees with him. Unlike a Dave Chapelle who is at least very talented at getting his personal world view across, Kamau simply regurgitated the news for the past year and ascribes racism to otherwise innocuous interactions he has had in life. He called a curious older lady racist: wrong! He called a store clerk at the airport racist: wrong! He encourages his daughters to compete over skin color-- how does someone laugh about that? His soliloquy about Doc McStuffin's was just disappointing... While diversity in preschool aged television is fantastic and beautiful I do not believe the intent is to discredit physicians of other races and ethnicities. His worldview is so infuriatingly narrow and dull for a so-called ""woke"" person. Can we stop using race and Trump as joke-fodder?

288,4851758,"Bridgette Everett performs a Central Comedy special in Joe's Pub in NYC. The show is basically comic sketches and musical acts that heavily incorporate the audience to make them even funnier. The jokes are pretty much all off-color, crude and even disturbing at times but it's very, very entertaining. I'm definitely not a fan of such humor (toilet humor, sexual humor, etc.) but I had a wide grin on my face the whole time and even a few LOL moments and I caught my wife, who's also anti-off-color-humor, giggling a few times. Including my own vote, 10 users voted an average of 6.1 for this show which is just about right. The breakdown of votes show females over 45 years old gave it the poorest rating so you know the show isn't for everyone but I'll go out on a limb and say I think everyone under 45 will enjoy this show. Not everyone will love it or even like it but they will be entertained just as I have. Honestly, and this is not flattering but I'm being honest, most of the time I couldn't avert my eyes in the way you can't look away from a highway car wreck. Here's a huge, over- weight, older white lady talking about her bosom and vagina and telling jokes about her sexual appetite and appeal. Even better, the way she climbs off the stage and interact with her audience in extremely unexpected manners. The audience themselves are probably not random people off the street but rather selected fans and maybe paid actors but I bet my house and dog they were entertained like crazy that evening. Lastly, I've never seen or heard of Bridgette before this show but it seems she has quite the fan base among A-list Hollywood stars. The cameos in the opening credits show you this but the cameo at the end credit is even bigger and better.

300,8697266,"...and that was in Freezing Hot. I really, really wanted to like this special, but it was such a step in the wrong direction that I just couldn't.A lot of what women go through is horrible and unfair, but a lot of what men go through is as well. I get that this special is from a female perspective, and I was really excited to hear about that from Iliza, but what I got was a lot of weak generalizations which fail to address that things really aren't that great for a lot of men either. Most of her special boils down to this: things are hard for women, and this is the fault of men and society (which translates to also men). One point that I really take issue with is one that was also made by Whitney Cummings in her spectacularly unfunny special ""I'm your Girlfriend"" about how men don't want to date successful women, that men only want women who appear vulnerable. I get that they aren't men and that their jokes are about this issue from their perspective, but has it ever occurred to them that maybe the reason that some men aren't interested in them is that the men are tired of feeling judged too? Maybe men have self esteem issues as well?Women are judged primarily on their appearance, while men are judged on their ability to provide. Iliza makes a joke at one point about how men like to think they are so much more observant than women, but she checked his credit score while he was complaining about his seat not facing the right way. So harsh, unrealistic standards towards women are bad, but men just have to accept them?I think what bothers me about this is that instead of attacking institutions or ideas which make EVERYONE miserable, Iliza decided to go for cheap approval and laughs by catering to half baked, quasi feminist types. There are larger issues here that I do think she is intelligent and funny enough to tackle, but instead she did her whole hashtag shtick, made some goat noises, and then effectively gave carte blanche to any woman with an ax to grind over her current or past relationships approval for blaming everything on their partner.Look, if the most interesting thing that you can think of to talk about during your 4th Netflix special is very generic material about dating that sounds way too similar to your old material about the same topic, then maybe it's time to take a critical look at your act and start working on some jokes that have punchlines that the audience can't see coming from the opener.

It was a moment when You start to think ""This is sad"". And I know that He likes to balance between ""Ha ha ha - I can't anymore"" and ""What just happened?Did he just had a breakdown?"" And in most cases this works, and He nails it - but not in this show. As He previously said ""It's funny to me"" so I guess he did it on purpose.***SPOILER ALERT***He opens with abortion, and the way he starts this was funny. But in other shows jokes he has an opinion on the matter, but this joke ends with him telling that he does not think that, and then he changes that he thinks that, but then again changes his opinion entirely. I haven't seen something like that in his jokes, usually he stand to it by the end and then tells that this is how he feels, or maybe that it isn't the way that works, but never changing his opinion on the matter.So at the end - there was only one funny joke where I lough out loud - about year 3 and how can it be year 3 when I am 26.

344,4909348,"In Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo, Schumer's hour-long HBO special filmed at the glorious Apollo theater in New York, Schumer expresses shock at the fact that she's been labeled as a ""sex comic."" She makes the understandable assertion that a male comic could come on stage, whip out his genitals, and still be labeled as a thinker while she has immediately been branded as a comic who focuses largely on sex and grossout humor. Her point would have validity if you weren't able to take all the parts that talk about sex, semen, sex acts, and other wonders and insights about intercourse out of Live at the Apollo and be left with roughly twenty-five minutes of material. And considering Schumer's breakout movie Trainwreck featured a character who was hellbent on having as many one-night-stands as a weekend would allow and her show Inside Amy Schumer features a great deal of racy music videos, I find it pretty appropriate to bill Schumer as a sex comic. There's nothing wrong with that label, but when a comedian makes an effort to reject the label and then continues to talk about the content that makes her earn the label, then something is drearily wrong with her ability to look introspectively at herself.Schumer's comedy is as bold as it is repetitive; it's a different kind of self-deprecation that basks in the sort of revealing and subversive attitude Schumer is so unapologetic about. If nothing else, she's not afraid to hide behind any kind of celebrity name or beat around the bush; she's not afraid to say things that will make you wince every now and then. Consider how she opens Live at the Apollo, by saying she met one of her goals this year, which was to take off a pair of underwear and have them not look like she blew her nose into them. She even goes on to talk at great length about how semen is under-appreciated and that Oprah could've easily ended up on a woman's breasts and that Michelle Obama likely has to clean up Barack Obama's ""troops"" from between her legs every week or so. This kind of humor and comedic brazenness (and honesty) is welcomed, but with that should come the ability to highlight and make note that your label of a sex comic is a fairly accurate one even if you say it isn't.Live at the Apollo is mostly good fun, but the repetitive aspects come when Schumer, like many comedians and young people today, feels the need to constantly reiterate her love for food and eating much of it. These jokes are tired, and are terrible attempts to pander to young people who go nuts on social media when Jennifer Lawrence says something at the Academy Awards about simply wanting to know where the food is. The obsession comedians have when they talk about their excessive dietary habits are tired, worn clichés of the highest order, and Schumer noting that she often has two lunches and wants to pour the entire bag of popcorn over her face while on a date at the theater is nothing new or funny, despite her acting like it is.If nothing else, this special showcases Schumer's composure and charisma when talking about the raciest subject matter. She always keeps a straight face and never seems to be laughing at her own material, and at an hour, her stay is welcomed and not overlong or noticeably underwritten. Her schtick only grows tired and worn if you recognize that if you prevented her from talking about sex and food, her material may struggle to fulfill the length requirements of a Saturday Night Live skit.NOTE: Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo will air throughout the entire month of November 2015 on HBO.Directed by: Chris Rock.",0,,ur23483288,4 November 2015,0,,338,252,6.059171597633136,0.7455621301775148,"('schumer', 8)('sex', 7)('apollo', 6)('live', 5)('comic', 5)('talk', 4)('nothing', 4)('label', 4)('amy', 3)('schumers', 3)","['amy', 'schumer', 'live', 'apollo', 'schumers', 'hourlong', 'hbo', 'special', 'filmed', 'glorious', 'apollo', 'theater', 'new', 'york', 'schumer', 'expresses', 'shock', 'fact', 'shes', 'labeled', 'sex', 'comic', 'makes', 'understandable', 'assertion', 'male', 'comic', 'could', 'come', 'stage', 'whip', 'genitals', 'still', 'labeled', 'thinker', 'immediately', 'branded', 'comic', 'focuses', 'largely', 'sex', 'grossout', 'humor', 'point', 'would', 'validity', 'werent', 'able', 'take', 'parts', 'talk', 'sex', 'semen', 'sex', 'acts', 'wonders', 'insights', 'intercourse', 'live', 'apollo', 'left', 'roughly', 'twentyfive', 'minutes', 'material', 'considering', 'schumers', 'breakout', 'movie', 'trainwreck', 'featured', 'character', 'hellbent', 'many', 'onenightstands', 'weekend', 'would', 'allow', 'show', 'inside', 'amy', 'schumer', 'features', 'great', 'deal', 'racy', 'music', 'videos', 'find', 'pretty', 'appropriate', 'bill', 'schumer', 'sex', 'comic', 'theres', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'label', 'comedian', 'makes', 'effort', 'reject', 'label', 'continues', 'talk', 'content', 'makes', 'earn', 'label', 'something', 'drearily', 'wrong', 'ability', 'look', 'introspectively', 'herselfschumers', 'comedy', 'bold', 'repetitive', 'different', 'kind', 'selfdeprecation', 'basks', 'sort', 'revealing', 'subversive', 'attitude', 'schumer', 'unapologetic', 'nothing', 'else', 'shes', 'afraid', 'hide', 'behind', 'kind', 'celebrity', 'name', 'beat', 'around', 'bush', 'shes', 'afraid', 'say', 'things', 'make', 'wince', 'every', 'consider', 'opens', 'live', 'apollo', 'saying', 'met', 'one', 'goals', 'year', 'take', 'pair', 'underwear', 'look', 'like', 'blew', 'nose', 'even', 'goes', 'talk', 'great', 'length', 'semen', 'underappreciated', 'oprah', 'couldve', 'easily', 'ended', 'womans', 'breasts', 'michelle', 'obama', 'likely', 'clean', 'barack', 'obamas', 'troops', 'legs', 'every', 'week', 'kind', 'humor', 'comedic', 'brazenness', 'honesty', 'welcomed', 'come', 'ability', 'highlight', 'make', 'note', 'label', 'sex', 'comic', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'one', 'even', 'say', 'isntlive', 'apollo', 'mostly', 'good', 'fun', 'repetitive', 'aspects', 'come', 'schumer', 'like', 'many', 'comedians', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'feels', 'need', 'constantly', 'reiterate', 'love', 'food', 'eating', 'much', 'jokes', 'tired', 'terrible', 'attempts', 'pander', 'young', 'people', 'go', 'nuts', 'social', 'media', 'jennifer', 'lawrence', 'says', 'something', 'academy', 'awards', 'simply', 'wanting', 'know', 'food', 'obsession', 'comedians', 'talk', 'excessive', 'dietary', 'habits', 'tired', 'worn', 'clichés', 'highest', 'order', 'schumer', 'noting', 'often', 'two', 'lunches', 'wants', 'pour', 'entire', 'bag', 'popcorn', 'face', 'date', 'theater', 'nothing', 'new', 'funny', 'despite', 'acting', 'like', 'isif', 'nothing', 'else', 'special', 'showcases', 'schumers', 'composure', 'charisma', 'talking', 'raciest', 'subject', 'matter', 'always', 'keeps', 'straight', 'face', 'never', 'seems', 'laughing', 'material', 'hour', 'stay', 'welcomed', 'overlong', 'noticeably', 'underwritten', 'schtick', 'grows', 'tired', 'worn', 'recognize', 'prevented', 'talking', 'sex', 'food', 'material', 'may', 'struggle', 'fulfill', 'length', 'requirements', 'saturday', 'night', 'live', 'skitnote', 'amy', 'schumer', 'live', 'apollo', 'air', 'throughout', 'entire', 'month', 'november', 'hbodirected', 'chris', 'rock']"

354,4669186,"'KEVIN HART: WHAT NOW?': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another stand-up comedy concert film starring Kevin Hart, who also co-wrote the screenplay (with Harry Ratchford and Joey Wells). It was directed by Tim Story and Leslie Small; who have also co- directed Hart's other stand-up comedy movies (Story has also worked with Hart on multiple other films as well). The movie begins with a spy skit, in which Hart plays a secret agent at an intense poker game, which leads into the concert part of the film. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it performed decently at the Box Office. I found it to be mildly amusing. The film begins with Agent 0054 (Hart), on assignment for MI6, entering a poker game. He meets his partner there, Money Berry (Halle Berry), and they're confronted by a Russian crime boss (David Meunier). After things turn violent, Agent 0054 rushes off to do a stand-up comedy performance; at Lincoln Financial Field, in Philadelphia (which Kevin Hart made history by selling out). The movie then proceeds with Hart's comedy performance.I'm not a big fan of stand-up comedy in general, unless it's really good (like Dave Chappelle). I think Kevin Hart is a hilarious actor, in most of the movies he does, but (as with most comedians) I don't think his stand-up comedy is nearly as hilarious. His jokes feel too forced to me, and they don't feel very natural (so they're not that funny, in my opinion). If you're a fan of most stand-up comedy though, or Kevin Hart as a stand-up comedian, than I'm sure you'll really like this movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY",0,,ur15977902,17 February 2017,0,,163,113,5.779141104294479,0.6932515337423313,"('hart', 8)('standup', 7)('comedy', 7)('kevin', 5)('movie', 4)('film', 3)('also', 3)('agent', 3)('concert', 2)('directed', 2)","['kevin', 'hart', 'two', 'half', 'stars', 'fiveanother', 'standup', 'comedy', 'concert', 'film', 'starring', 'kevin', 'hart', 'also', 'cowrote', 'screenplay', 'harry', 'ratchford', 'joey', 'wells', 'directed', 'tim', 'story', 'leslie', 'small', 'also', 'co', 'directed', 'harts', 'standup', 'comedy', 'movies', 'story', 'also', 'worked', 'hart', 'multiple', 'films', 'well', 'movie', 'begins', 'spy', 'skit', 'hart', 'plays', 'secret', 'agent', 'intense', 'poker', 'game', 'leads', 'concert', 'part', 'film', 'received', 'mostly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'critics', 'performed', 'decently', 'box', 'office', 'found', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'film', 'begins', 'agent', 'hart', 'assignment', 'entering', 'poker', 'game', 'meets', 'partner', 'money', 'berry', 'halle', 'berry', 'theyre', 'confronted', 'russian', 'crime', 'boss', 'david', 'meunier', 'things', 'turn', 'violent', 'agent', 'rushes', 'standup', 'comedy', 'performance', 'lincoln', 'financial', 'field', 'philadelphia', 'kevin', 'hart', 'made', 'history', 'selling', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'harts', 'comedy', 'performanceim', 'big', 'fan', 'standup', 'comedy', 'general', 'unless', 'really', 'good', 'like', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'think', 'kevin', 'hart', 'hilarious', 'actor', 'movies', 'comedians', 'dont', 'think', 'standup', 'comedy', 'nearly', 'hilarious', 'jokes', 'feel', 'forced', 'dont', 'feel', 'natural', 'theyre', 'funny', 'opinion', 'youre', 'fan', 'standup', 'comedy', 'though', 'kevin', 'hart', 'standup', 'comedian', 'im', 'sure', 'youll', 'really', 'like', 'moviewatch', 'movie', 'review', 'show', 'movie', 'talk', 'review']"

For fans of Kevin Hart and his type of humor, many would enjoy this stand up as he is doing his usual scheme. His comedy is definitely one which is acquired taste. The jokes in this stand up come from his mannerisms, actions, repetitive phrases and overall impressions and tone in his delivery. Many jokes hit while some do fall short.

As for the comedy portion, I feel bad for all those who paid to fill a football stadium to see KH.I only smiled and chuckled in the last 15-20 min of the show (I did not laugh once though), and the rest was dragged out far too long and didn't make any sense. His stories where boring and not funny. Where was the punch line about the raccoon that he saw (and his dad)? He kept saying he doesn't lie in his comedy. So then he was lying about this raccoon or he was smoking some really good stuff. Showing concern for only himself and not his family is not comedy.

Hart parodies James Bond more specifically Casino Royal and does this with special guess the lovely bond girl Halle Berry and Don Cheadele who was hilarious. Hart is pumping his superstar muscle here.The concert itself was a far bigger stage. The cool part was how some of the images behind him reflected the comedy routine. Far much going on than the pyrotechnics he gave us in Let Me Explain.But the fire he laid on us was real funny and far more inter graded into the comedy bit.

361,4669186,"I saw ""Kevin Hart:What Now?"", starring Kevin Hart-Central Intelligence, Death at a Funeral; Halle Berry-The X-Men movies, Catwoman; Don Cheadle- House of Lies-TV, the Iron Man movies and Ed Helms-Vacation_2015, The Hangover movies.This is another Kevin Hart stand up comedy special-I think his 3rd and he says, it's his last-where he sold out a football stadium in Philadelphia with about 50,000 people in attendance. I'm sure I am in the minority here, but I just did not think it was that funny. I thought Kevin was funny in Central Intelligence and the Ride Along movies. Well, just about all of his other movies, too. But I just don't care for his stand up. FYI: I did not hear anyone else in my theater laugh during the whole movie. Kevin just tells stories about his girlfriend, kids, father and friends. He doesn't really tell jokes. And, he cusses a lot. To me, it just wasn't funny. Now, at the beginning, he does a James Bond styled opening where he goes to a casino with Halle and plays poker. I liked that better. They should have made a whole movie about that. Don plays a fellow poker player and Ed is the bartender. Kevin also imitates a scene straight out of the Equalizer. You know, the one where Denzel takes out all the bad guys in the office in about 18 seconds. Now I will admit, I don't know what any of this has to do with his stand up but I did like those parts. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. I would not buy this on DVD. I don't think I would rent it either.

362,4669186,"What we learn about Kevin is that family is very important to him. Be it his now wife, his kids who don't got enough edge in his opinion, or his crazy dad. However, ain't no way in hell he would put their life before his own. Ain't no way in hell if his girlfriend is attacked by anything and looks like the next horror movie icon is he staying with her. Hell Nah. Yet he does love them and their eccentric ways. Though sometimes he just has to ask himself, as many of his fans and peers do when it comes to what is next in his career, ""What Now?""Highlights59 uncontrollable laughs and who knows how many smiles and chuckles. All thanks to jokes dealing with animal attacks, sex toys, the complications of relationships, being a dad and dealing with his dad, and of course the kids who seem like such characters that it is hard to fathom where the truth ends and Kevin's embellishments begin.The best jokes came from him building off not only his fear of animal attacks but how he would handle if his fiancé at the time got attacked and mauled by an animal – but lived. That joke, as well as lying because the truth isn't believable. Low PointsSome jokes Kevin grinds into the ground to the point they just aren't funny anymore. One joke being about the face and script Black women use when they don't believe a story. Another thing which kind of got lame was how he would repeat the same line over and over. If you're familiar with Kevin's work, part of what makes him funny is the voices he does and his facial expressions. Well, he really drags out what is one of his best assets and plays up to the camera and everything. Problem is, he treats it like a hill and valley type of joke. Meaning, the first time is funny because the expression is new, but then it gets old and you expect him to move on – hence the valley. However, he keeps going and while some find it ridiculous enough to work their way up that hill to a laugh, some like me question when is he moving on and why is he milking this joke for all it's worth?Overall: On The Fence (Home Viewing)While longer than his previous stand-up movie, there is this weird sequel feeling to this movie. Like the best jokes and times are behind us and while there is still something there, a strong reminder why you went to the movies to see this, it is just not the same. Which I know is weird to say when I laughed so much, but the jokes build off his family like you should be aware who all these characters are. On top of that, I still have no idea why he has these pre-standup segments. This time around he is parodying the latest bond movie and The Equalizer a little bit. Something that, even with Halle Berry and Don Cheadle assisting, isn't funny nor interesting. It is like a bad opening act which makes you glad once the headliner comes on.But the reason why I'm marking this as on the fence vs. positive is because it doesn't feel like Kevin really took it to the next level to the point you should leave your home to see this. This just feels like a really good HBO or Comedy Central special that is getting a limited theatrical release just to make some extra money.",0,,ur6177494,13 October 2016,0,,282,211,5.48936170212766,0.74822695035461,"('like', 9)('jokes', 5)('movie', 4)('joke', 4)('funny', 4)('kevin', 3)('got', 3)('dad', 3)('way', 3)('hell', 3)","['learn', 'kevin', 'family', 'important', 'wife', 'kids', 'dont', 'got', 'enough', 'edge', 'opinion', 'crazy', 'dad', 'however', 'aint', 'way', 'hell', 'would', 'put', 'life', 'aint', 'way', 'hell', 'girlfriend', 'attacked', 'anything', 'looks', 'like', 'next', 'horror', 'movie', 'icon', 'staying', 'hell', 'nah', 'yet', 'love', 'eccentric', 'ways', 'though', 'sometimes', 'ask', 'many', 'fans', 'peers', 'comes', 'next', 'career', 'uncontrollable', 'laughs', 'knows', 'many', 'smiles', 'chuckles', 'thanks', 'jokes', 'dealing', 'animal', 'attacks', 'sex', 'toys', 'complications', 'relationships', 'dad', 'dealing', 'dad', 'course', 'kids', 'seem', 'like', 'characters', 'hard', 'fathom', 'truth', 'ends', 'kevins', 'embellishments', 'beginthe', 'best', 'jokes', 'came', 'building', 'fear', 'animal', 'attacks', 'would', 'handle', 'fiancé', 'time', 'got', 'attacked', 'mauled', 'animal', 'lived', 'joke', 'well', 'lying', 'truth', 'isnt', 'believable', 'low', 'pointssome', 'jokes', 'kevin', 'grinds', 'ground', 'point', 'arent', 'funny', 'anymore', 'one', 'joke', 'face', 'script', 'black', 'women', 'use', 'dont', 'believe', 'story', 'another', 'thing', 'kind', 'got', 'lame', 'would', 'repeat', 'line', 'youre', 'familiar', 'kevins', 'work', 'part', 'makes', 'funny', 'voices', 'facial', 'expressions', 'well', 'really', 'drags', 'one', 'best', 'assets', 'plays', 'camera', 'everything', 'problem', 'treats', 'like', 'hill', 'valley', 'type', 'joke', 'meaning', 'first', 'time', 'funny', 'expression', 'new', 'gets', 'old', 'expect', 'move', 'hence', 'valley', 'however', 'keeps', 'going', 'find', 'ridiculous', 'enough', 'work', 'way', 'hill', 'laugh', 'like', 'question', 'moving', 'milking', 'joke', 'worthoverall', 'fence', 'home', 'viewingwhile', 'longer', 'previous', 'standup', 'movie', 'weird', 'sequel', 'feeling', 'movie', 'like', 'best', 'jokes', 'times', 'behind', 'us', 'still', 'something', 'strong', 'reminder', 'went', 'movies', 'see', 'know', 'weird', 'say', 'laughed', 'much', 'jokes', 'build', 'family', 'like', 'aware', 'characters', 'top', 'still', 'idea', 'prestandup', 'segments', 'time', 'around', 'parodying', 'latest', 'bond', 'movie', 'equalizer', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'even', 'halle', 'berry', 'cheadle', 'assisting', 'isnt', 'funny', 'interesting', 'like', 'bad', 'opening', 'act', 'makes', 'glad', 'headliner', 'comes', 'onbut', 'reason', 'im', 'marking', 'fence', 'vs', 'positive', 'doesnt', 'feel', 'like', 'kevin', 'really', 'took', 'next', 'level', 'point', 'leave', 'home', 'see', 'feels', 'like', 'really', 'good', 'hbo', 'comedy', 'central', 'special', 'getting', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'make', 'extra', 'money']"

364,4669186,"Comedian Kevin Hart's career to date has been a mixed bag. He has made millions laugh with his stand-up act (in comedy clubs and on tour), on television and in the movies – sometimes as a supporting character and sometimes as the star – including, of course, his concert films featuring his stand-up. He has written and produced for TV and movies (mostly, but not exclusively, for himself). His comedy projects have consistently made handsome profits, but have received mixed reviews from critics and, in some cases, audiences. As someone who tries to maintain the balance between movie reviewer and Movie Fan, here's how I see Kevin Hart's effectiveness in some of his films: ""Grudge Match"", ""The Wedding Ringer"", ""Get Hard"" – funny. ""Ride Along"", ""Ride Along 2"", ""Central Intelligence"" – mildly amusing. His 2016 concert movie ""Kevin Hart: What Now?"" (R, 1:36) – not funny. Please, let me explain.Kevin Hart's 2016 concert film opens with a significant, but irrelevant sequence in which he plays a James Bond type of character (opposite Halle Berry) and participates in a high-stakes poker game, a la Daniel Craig's first Bond outing, ""Casino Royale"". In this opener for Hart's film (basically a movie within a movie), production values are high and the acting is good (including cool cameos by Don Cheadle and others), but there are few laughs and the whole thing has almost nothing to do with what comes next.After his spy adventure, Hart appears at a packed Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Eagles) in Philadelphia where he performs his usual type of stand-up routine – with some social and political commentary and a whole lot of stories and jokes based on his family life and other personal experiences – all infused with his signature brand of physical comedy. Most of his jokes come from how ridiculous he thinks the members of his family are – and what people would be like if they were deprived of various parts of their body (e.g. arms and legs, shoulders, etc.) due to a variety of extraordinary mishaps.Of course, this being a comedy concert film, there are plenty of shots of people in the crowd laughing at Hart's antics and repeating some of the lines he uses. He performs with nothing but a mic and a stool, but is backed up by large video screens with images illustrating some of the stories he tells. Then, at the end of his routine, there's a brief scene in which Hart picks up where he left off with Halle Berry and seems to be teasing a future project – basically answering the question posed in his concert film's title.The movie commits the greatest possible sin of a comedy concert film – not being very funny. The laughs from Hart's live audience were seldom echoed in the crowded theater where I saw the movie. No wonder. Comedy usually plays better in person than on a screen – and people are more primed to enjoy comedy the more time and money they spend to see it (as in, the cost of a live show that you went to in a large venue, versus a cheaper ticket in a comparatively small movie theater), but the main problem with this film is the comedy itself. Hart talks at length about far-fetched situations that are more bizarre than funny. He also refers to his family members (father, children and fiancé) in ways that are more disrespectful than humorous. What's more, much like in his movies, Hart relies too much on his over-the-top facial expressions for laughs.

(spoiler free)*** (3/5)AS A COMEDY film star Kevin Hart isn't funny as his annoying high pitched voice takes over the entirety of the movies, and he delivers one high pitched screamed un-funny line to the other horrendously un-funny line. However as an on-stage stand-up comedian he is relentlessly funny; for the most part anyway. After the staggering success of his other live concert movies Let Me Explain and Laugh at my Pain he returns to his home town tour in Philadelphia with more comedic material performing live in front of a record-breaking 50,000 people at Philadelphia's outdoor venue, the Lincoln Financial Field an American football stadium, it is the biggest ever audience for a comedy show as the stadium is at capacity. What Now? opens with an ill-advised short film like sketch directed by Tim Story, no not the director of the Ride Along series, as it stars Hart as a spy named Agent 0054 alongside Halle Berry, unfortunately this is Hart with his usual mannerisms or Hartisms as it relies on poor continuity with the jokes so it delivers more dry laughs as he tries to be funny but drastically fails. The scene plays in a casino that he has to go into to find a person to infiltrate look out for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo of Hangover star Ed Helms, but the rest of the scene although original is filled with poor continuation, repetition and even a mediocre fight scene with Hart being braver than he normally is and not screaming his lungs out every few minutes. All this takes place three hours before the show, and it ends with Hart covered in blood and changing for the show. Finally he appears on stage with black-on-black attire and some more original material with 50,000 people thinking he is a good. While watching a live comedy performance on such a big stage in front of a massive audience there is always one thing to consider; how funny is the material? Or will it stop funny half way through? In What Now it relies on some of the simplest pleasures and that is Hart's storytelling as he mainly talks about his personal life with his kids and his wife, whom he calls his lady as we learn that some of the funniest comedy comes that comes from the performer is always comedy about real life places and people. So, Hart takes over the stage shouting, screaming, sweating and pacing telling these relentlessly funny stories about his kids and the camera shows some of the audience holding their head in their hands and crying with laughter. What follows through-out for most of the entire film is this material about his adored personal life that has quite a range as it starts out being sort of funny, and then continues to be hugely hilarious with every single member of the audience screaming and laughing and even a couple of time can be seen copying some of the lines. This only happens in the first 2/3 of the movie, but unfortunately the last 1/3 relies on drearier storytelling, same old material as he copies some of the same jokes and there are mediocre laughs as some of the audience starts to get a little bored, there are a couple of moments that stick out but none of them will take of the hilarity over the 2/3 of the film. To end it goes back to the ending of the spy sketch and continuing with the poor comedic standard and he wants to take his comedy all over the world and asks will the world think he is funny? So is he funny? It all depends. Despite some of the un-funny Hollywood trappings, in the Ride Along double and some massively ill-advised giant-screen visuals which intend to augment some of his hackneyed routines, Hart's actual stand-up is funny and doesn't rely on too much movie bombast or too heavy of a Hollywood ego.VERDICT: Hart's third live concert movie is relentlessly funny for the most part with 50,000 people thinking he's hilarious and crying with laughter, but unfortunately the rest of What Now is filled with repetition, poor continuation and dry mediocre laughs.6/10 mediocre.",0,,ur53918492,21 November 2016,0,,353,242,6.232294617563739,0.6855524079320113,"('funny', 11)('hart', 7)('comedy', 6)('material', 5)('audience', 5)('film', 4)('live', 4)('people', 4)('poor', 4)('mediocre', 4)","['review', 'kevin', 'hart', 'spoiler', 'free', 'comedy', 'film', 'star', 'kevin', 'hart', 'isnt', 'funny', 'annoying', 'high', 'pitched', 'voice', 'takes', 'entirety', 'movies', 'delivers', 'one', 'high', 'pitched', 'screamed', 'unfunny', 'line', 'horrendously', 'unfunny', 'line', 'however', 'onstage', 'standup', 'comedian', 'relentlessly', 'funny', 'part', 'anyway', 'staggering', 'success', 'live', 'concert', 'movies', 'let', 'explain', 'laugh', 'pain', 'returns', 'home', 'town', 'tour', 'philadelphia', 'comedic', 'material', 'performing', 'live', 'front', 'recordbreaking', 'people', 'philadelphias', 'outdoor', 'venue', 'lincoln', 'financial', 'field', 'american', 'football', 'stadium', 'biggest', 'ever', 'audience', 'comedy', 'show', 'stadium', 'capacity', 'opens', 'illadvised', 'short', 'film', 'like', 'sketch', 'directed', 'tim', 'story', 'director', 'ride', 'along', 'series', 'stars', 'hart', 'spy', 'named', 'agent', 'alongside', 'halle', 'berry', 'unfortunately', 'hart', 'usual', 'mannerisms', 'hartisms', 'relies', 'poor', 'continuity', 'jokes', 'delivers', 'dry', 'laughs', 'tries', 'funny', 'drastically', 'fails', 'scene', 'plays', 'casino', 'go', 'find', 'person', 'infiltrate', 'look', 'blinkandyoullmissit', 'cameo', 'hangover', 'star', 'ed', 'helms', 'rest', 'scene', 'although', 'original', 'filled', 'poor', 'continuation', 'repetition', 'even', 'mediocre', 'fight', 'scene', 'hart', 'braver', 'normally', 'screaming', 'lungs', 'every', 'minutes', 'takes', 'place', 'three', 'hours', 'show', 'ends', 'hart', 'covered', 'blood', 'changing', 'show', 'finally', 'appears', 'stage', 'blackonblack', 'attire', 'original', 'material', 'people', 'thinking', 'good', 'watching', 'live', 'comedy', 'performance', 'big', 'stage', 'front', 'massive', 'audience', 'always', 'one', 'thing', 'consider', 'funny', 'material', 'stop', 'funny', 'half', 'way', 'relies', 'simplest', 'pleasures', 'harts', 'storytelling', 'mainly', 'talks', 'personal', 'life', 'kids', 'wife', 'calls', 'lady', 'learn', 'funniest', 'comedy', 'comes', 'comes', 'performer', 'always', 'comedy', 'real', 'life', 'places', 'people', 'hart', 'takes', 'stage', 'shouting', 'screaming', 'sweating', 'pacing', 'telling', 'relentlessly', 'funny', 'stories', 'kids', 'camera', 'shows', 'audience', 'holding', 'head', 'hands', 'crying', 'laughter', 'follows', 'throughout', 'entire', 'film', 'material', 'adored', 'personal', 'life', 'quite', 'range', 'starts', 'sort', 'funny', 'continues', 'hugely', 'hilarious', 'every', 'single', 'member', 'audience', 'screaming', 'laughing', 'even', 'couple', 'time', 'seen', 'copying', 'lines', 'happens', 'first', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'last', 'relies', 'drearier', 'storytelling', 'old', 'material', 'copies', 'jokes', 'mediocre', 'laughs', 'audience', 'starts', 'get', 'little', 'bored', 'couple', 'moments', 'stick', 'none', 'take', 'hilarity', 'film', 'end', 'goes', 'back', 'ending', 'spy', 'sketch', 'continuing', 'poor', 'comedic', 'standard', 'wants', 'take', 'comedy', 'world', 'asks', 'world', 'think', 'funny', 'funny', 'depends', 'despite', 'unfunny', 'hollywood', 'trappings', 'ride', 'along', 'double', 'massively', 'illadvised', 'giantscreen', 'visuals', 'intend', 'augment', 'hackneyed', 'routines', 'harts', 'actual', 'standup', 'funny', 'doesnt', 'rely', 'much', 'movie', 'bombast', 'heavy', 'hollywood', 'egoverdict', 'harts', 'third', 'live', 'concert', 'movie', 'relentlessly', 'funny', 'part', 'people', 'thinking', 'hes', 'hilarious', 'crying', 'laughter', 'unfortunately', 'rest', 'filled', 'repetition', 'poor', 'continuation', 'dry', 'mediocre', 'mediocre']"

First half of the stand up act was pretty boring and joke were on some very low level and he tried to move crowd with his acting and giving a performance but it was not enough as he just did not deliver jokes as we are used to. Then came second half and he was all over the place, instantly he felt like Kevin and joke felt original giving a good thing to the movie. From that point it was extremely funny and there are some of the best jokes that he ever had. There is a lot of room for improvement and there are things to learn from this movie.

My wife didn't laugh once. describes gross subjects while making gross faces. That's it. That's the whole special - or I assume it is. I quit watching with about fifteen minutes left, but I saw enough to be assured that it wasn't going to get any more funny. I'm not making fun of her weight because being heavy doesn't matter in comedy, but I think her appearance merits a mention. She wears a smallish, tight leather dress that along with a bad hairdo choice and horrible make-up creates an unflattering, swollen look that is a negative distraction.

It's also because the sound is not form that visuals: Second, the sound is for the most part is not from the concert. It's obviously not live recording which is especially evident by Madonna's vocals. Only some slower songs retain the original vocals.

I wonder if he's joking about the jokes or serious about the joking. The O.J. stuff is probably the easiest to digest and the most fun. The Bill Crosby through-line is probably the most personal. It is the conflicted musing of a younger man about his fallen hero. He also has some sly fun about Key & Peele.

388,6648926,"Here's something I love about Dave Chappelle, which he's done in his stand-up since Killing em Softly and probably before: that moment, which he does more than once so it's either a playful thing he can't control or a timed movement, where after making a particularly outrageous or spot-on joke or puch-to-the-gut-line, he tapes a step or two back, falls halfway over, and laughs a little. The thing to remember though is that by the time we're seeing The Age of Spin, he's given this same piece of material to people in nightclubs over and over, as is the way that stand-ups do it through trial and error (if there is someone that can come fully formed to the stage for a live *taped* one-hour special he or she would be as special as... well, one of the superheroes that Chappelle 'pitches' to the gay and white-hatred-filled executives, perhaps). But it's always an infectious beat, whether he's doing it as part of his performance or if it's a natural reaction - it lets us know, 'g-ddamn, did I say that... yeah, I did, hahah!'Speaking of that super-heroes bit, let's look at that briefly (how can one not, it's one of the highlights). This is one of those pieces that can (and probably already has) set off some ""HEY!"" remarks from both LGBTQ people (he actually addresses that too by the way, those in that acronym), and... actually I'm not sure if I've heard much from the white-trash contingent of the internet yet. Yet framing is always paramount, and here Chappelle starts off this piece about how he is put upon at some post-Oscars party or other about any movie ideas - he tells us, the audience, that he had none, but he can't say that to executives, so he comes up with the most (no pun intended) half- baked ideas based on the stereotypes that come with either being gay or a white, Texan scumbag: the former involves elements (I won't mention here, won't spoil the joke) that might appeal to the gay person, and the latter involves things that are more leaning on what might be the *male* hatred of women (if you want save the world, you got to touch a vagina, and since women find that gross, well... how about some rape to save the world?!) It's easy to see why Chappelle's words would be offensive to people, I get it. If you are, then I'm sorry that he f***ed you over in a comedy routine. But, again, the framing of it counts: in Age of Spin he's not going after gays or women/feminists or transgendered or even Bill Cosby... okay, he does go after him, but it's about so much else *around* these issues, perceptions and types and things that make individuals become these types and are seen as less than. As a black man he knows the less-than part clearly, and immediately does something clever: the early bits here are about being black but also what fame does when that's thrown in (i.e. when he's with his friend and his friend is put in the back of the cop car but he isn't, or that piece about not going to Flynt). At worst he may seem to be out of touch as a celebrity more than he was back in 2000 or even 2004. But then what's to be made later on when he brings up his son's overwhelming adoration (and Dave's own jealousy/envy) of Kevin Hart and his live show? I found this special brilliant and, more importantly, awesomely funny all around for how Chappelle constructs his jokes and gets in the absurdity and humor in just the right spots, hits things as if a boxer does when knowing to stand back a little and (in a beat) be serious, and then throw in a joke as if it's nothing, and then to go for the bigger hits. He even has an overriding arc involving four stories of meeting OJ Simpson - someone who, before Cosby, was likely the most notorious case of a black American hero to many people who fell down hard - and each one takes us through different periods in Dave's as well as OJ's rise and falls in the past 25 years. If anything that adds another layer to the context of the other bits, which involve largely celebrity and how we look at ""others"" and people's reactions who are on the outside to how the other is too (the highlight of that is Dave reenacting a contentious night doing stand-up where a woman confronted him during his act about how much women have suffered, and he's with her struggle... up to a point). So in some ways he's deepened a little with his bits. In other ways... he's the same old Dave.

396,6648926,"Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, children of all ages, grandmothers and grandfathers, Dave Cha-Pezzy is back, the one and only Dave Chappelle is back!Dave Chappelle (Half – Baked, The Chappelle Show) the comedy icon, makes his long awaited return to the screen and to the stage. Dave Chappelle now has a Netflix Original stand-up comedy special. With new, mature, raunchy, contemptuous, and always compelling comedy material. Now if you are coming into this thinking you're getting that Chappelle that says, ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"" Or him as Lil John, Prince, and as everyone's favorite crackhead Tyrone Biggums, you are not getting that. What you have here is a more mature Chappelle that has grown, and discusses more of his daily life. That's right Dave Chappelle grew up. He discusses politics, sex, scandals, race issues, kids, the education system, marriage, and all that good stuff. The stand-up special is actually two parts. The first part is titled, The Age of Spin Live at The Hollywood Palladium. The second part is titled, Deep in the Heart of Texas: Dave Chappelle Live at Austin City Limits. Fans online have been debating which special is better. I believe they are both well done. However, I do believe the first special is better. I personally enjoyed The Age of Spin Live at The Hollywood Palladium more for a variety of reasons. It really does feel like he is talking to the audience, he hasn't performed in L.A. in 10 years, it is more mature, it's funny, and you truly do feel like he is happy to be back, and happy to have grown as a comedian.That doesn't mean it is a perfect stand-up special, because in my opinion it is not. One of the biggest issues I have is the topics of current events.I wish there were more recent news topics Chappelle discussed in his special. For example, he could have made jokes and or statements about Trump, Obama leaving office, movies, trends, television shows (like when he played Negan from Walking Dead on Saturday Night Live), social media, and the entertainment industry then vs. now. Talking about Bill Cosby and O.J. Simpson now feels just a little dated. Even though the jokes are funny, just more fresher topics could have been used. I appreciate him taking a serious topic and adding a light hearted and funny message behind it though. The first special ishow can I put this? Stupid funny. He tells a joke about every time he has met O.J. and each one of them is hilarious, but really stupid. For instance, this isn't a spoiler, but it involves Chappelle and O.J.'s wife. Chappelle reenacts when he met O.J.'s wife and he says, ""Woman, are you trying' to get us both killed?"" Furthermore, he literally opens the show telling the crowd, ""You all better be a tough crowd, I'm going to say some stuff, so don't get mad."" So if you are someone who is easily offended this is NOT for you. On the other hand, if you are someone who has thick skin and can take race jokes, sex jokes, and profanity the by all means 'njoy.What I mainly enjoyed about the 2nd half is Chappelle discussing more of his private life. For example, his young son getting into a fight with girl. Chappelle mentions how he took a bite out of his son's school lunch, and then put it back in the bag so his son wouldn't notice. His son thought it was a girl in the class, and it ended up with his son slapping a little girl. This isn't the first father dilemma Chappelle discusses. Also, Chappelle discusses his marriage. He has been married since 2001, and he talks about/makes jokes about long marriages and relationships. I was cracking up laughing, when he mentions when his wife leaves the house he likes to get naked, jerk off and eat cereal in the living room. That's what I mean when I say you are getting more of the old Chappelle on this second half of the stand-up special. In my opinion, this half had too many sex jokes and gay jokes. It started out funny, but then I was ready for him to move onto the next topic. Overall, these are my final thoughts on Dave Chappelle's stand-up Netflix Special. Netflix announced these aren't the only two specials we are getting. There are more coming on the way towards the end of the year, and I say bring it on. Chappelle is more than Rick James, bitch. He is funny, has improved, has matured, he is a comedy king, and like Comedy Central has stated, I do believe he is one of the greatest comedians of all time. I believe this earns4 out of 5 Hairpieces!Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)Now if you'll excuse me, much like Dave Chappelle, I need to get my bowl of cereal ready and head on into the living room.

397,6648926,"Dave Chappelle is undoubtedly a modern day great of standup comedy. The age of spin: Dave Chappelle live at the Hollywood palladium 2017 is one of the cleverest, most relevant comedy shows I've ever watched. He's not just sharp, he weaves in the current climate of anger and disappointment into issues dividing the people, like discrimination over race, gender, etc. He looks at complex and complicated issues like the OJ Simpson trial and Bill Cosby rape allegations and traces the history of rights movements, the world war, the ensuing cold war, the change in social and cultural roles, brilliantly. He reminds us that when idols fall, what we should never ignore is the contribution they have invariably made over decades, visible and invisible, that have touched the lives of millions, and not dismiss them outright or judge them as easily as we do. Dave Chappelle, in his comeback, shows that what made him such a massively popular star in the field of entertainment two decades ago, is very much alive in him. He is relevant because he stays relevant not just because he choses topics that are current, but because he has an acute sensitivity to history and contemporary social currents, which he merges brilliantly with his acerbic, irreverent mind to create entertainment that makes us laugh out loud, but also, lingers in our minds much later, making us think deeply.He'll have a place in entertainment as one of the legends of comedy.",0,,ur45055448,14 May 2019,0,1.0,135,111,6.303703703703704,0.8222222222222222,"('dave', 3)('chappelle', 3)('comedy', 3)('relevant', 3)('us', 3)('entertainment', 3)('one', 2)('shows', 2)('current', 2)('issues', 2)","['dave', 'chappelle', 'undoubtedly', 'modern', 'day', 'great', 'standup', 'comedy', 'age', 'spin', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'live', 'hollywood', 'palladium', 'one', 'cleverest', 'relevant', 'comedy', 'shows', 'ive', 'ever', 'watched', 'hes', 'sharp', 'weaves', 'current', 'climate', 'anger', 'disappointment', 'issues', 'dividing', 'people', 'like', 'discrimination', 'race', 'gender', 'etc', 'looks', 'complex', 'complicated', 'issues', 'like', 'oj', 'simpson', 'trial', 'bill', 'cosby', 'rape', 'allegations', 'traces', 'history', 'rights', 'movements', 'world', 'war', 'ensuing', 'cold', 'war', 'change', 'social', 'cultural', 'roles', 'brilliantly', 'reminds', 'us', 'idols', 'fall', 'never', 'ignore', 'contribution', 'invariably', 'made', 'decades', 'visible', 'invisible', 'touched', 'lives', 'millions', 'dismiss', 'outright', 'judge', 'easily', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'comeback', 'shows', 'made', 'massively', 'popular', 'star', 'field', 'entertainment', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'much', 'alive', 'relevant', 'stays', 'relevant', 'choses', 'topics', 'current', 'acute', 'sensitivity', 'history', 'contemporary', 'social', 'currents', 'merges', 'brilliantly', 'acerbic', 'irreverent', 'mind', 'create', 'entertainment', 'makes', 'us', 'laugh', 'loud', 'also', 'lingers', 'minds', 'much', 'later', 'making', 'us', 'think', 'deeplyhell', 'place', 'entertainment', 'one', 'legends', 'comedy']"

Is this good? Was that a good joke or a bad joke? Has he gone crazy or is he normal now? Does the crowd like him? Do they think he is trying too hard? Should I like this or not? Is this politically correct or purposefully inflammatory? Whats gonna happen next?...The SECOND time I watched it however, I had a couple of glasses of wine, felt relaxed, and already knew its gonna be a good show. What I realized then is this: Here is a funny, empathetic, down to earth guy, telling funny stories.

He covers everything from films, Star Trek, cats, shopping and supermarkets.Back in 1994 Izzard was still of the mind that comedy should not be made for TV  in fact it was rare for any of his live shows to be put on TV. To this day he hasn't been tempted to make a sitcom in the same way as other standups of his generation have (Lee Evans' `so what now' shows he was right!).This show is a perfect example of Eddie at his best  his mind going in a million different directions but being held in place by his original script, his ideas surprising and delighting the audience. It may not hold up to repeated viewings, but it's still very funny while it's fresh.. Izzard is a transvestite but this isn't his show  in fact it barely matters after the first 30 seconds.You can see the influence of Monty Python and The Goons in his work  his surreal thought process is straight from Milligan himself (RIP).

424,0184424,"As a break from long form narrative, I have been watching a lot of films of standup comics. It is one of the most puzzling things I have done recently. Nothing tells you more in a short time about someone than what they find funny. Part of that is the structure of the humor, the core of what I've been studying. But it is worth remarking that some component is what we want to believe is funny. Some of that is physical group dynamics; we join in groups in order to laugh. A related affiliation is incorporated into the humor -- race and class comedians exploit this. Sometimes you leave just feeling dirty afterwards by the association.I think Chris Rock brilliantly exploits this by alternately seducing us into joining a group and then allowing us to make fun of ourselves for doing so. Izzard works with a quite different sort of humor. I think I will characterize it as similar to Rock, but instead of joining a group, he tricks us into joining a narrative or reminding us of a narrative we already joined. Then instead of directly making fun of it or us, he takes it seriously to an extreme. This allows us to think we are laughing at him rather than ourselves, removing that barrier of ironic self-loathing. Underscoring this is his persona as a self-hating, ugly transvestite. Being a successful standup comic must be one of the hardest, most fragile things you can do. If you can do it and have the audience leave actually feeling better -- well, that is a gift.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",0,,ur0643062,21 February 2011,0,,130,104,6.376923076923077,0.8,"('us', 6)('narrative', 3)('humor', 3)('group', 3)('think', 3)('joining', 3)('watching', 2)('standup', 2)('one', 2)('things', 2)","['break', 'long', 'form', 'narrative', 'watching', 'lot', 'films', 'standup', 'comics', 'one', 'puzzling', 'things', 'done', 'recently', 'nothing', 'tells', 'short', 'time', 'someone', 'find', 'funny', 'part', 'structure', 'humor', 'core', 'ive', 'studying', 'worth', 'remarking', 'component', 'want', 'believe', 'funny', 'physical', 'group', 'dynamics', 'join', 'groups', 'order', 'laugh', 'related', 'affiliation', 'incorporated', 'humor', 'race', 'class', 'comedians', 'exploit', 'sometimes', 'leave', 'feeling', 'dirty', 'afterwards', 'associationi', 'think', 'chris', 'rock', 'brilliantly', 'exploits', 'alternately', 'seducing', 'us', 'joining', 'group', 'allowing', 'us', 'make', 'fun', 'izzard', 'works', 'quite', 'different', 'sort', 'humor', 'think', 'characterize', 'similar', 'rock', 'instead', 'joining', 'group', 'tricks', 'us', 'joining', 'narrative', 'reminding', 'us', 'narrative', 'already', 'joined', 'instead', 'directly', 'making', 'fun', 'us', 'takes', 'seriously', 'extreme', 'allows', 'us', 'think', 'laughing', 'rather', 'removing', 'barrier', 'ironic', 'selfloathing', 'underscoring', 'persona', 'selfhating', 'ugly', 'transvestite', 'successful', 'standup', 'comic', 'must', 'one', 'hardest', 'fragile', 'things', 'audience', 'leave', 'actually', 'feeling', 'better', 'well', 'giftteds', 'evaluation', 'worth', 'watching']"

426,0184424,"Before last night, I must confess that I was an Eddie Izzard virgin. While I may have witnessed him in several film roles, it wasn't until this moment did I honestly know who this man was, how he thought, or that is true calling was in front of a large American audience making us chuckle at ourselves. Izzard is a transvestite, and is not ashamed to announce this to his audiences. Our first image of Izzard is in full make-up dressed as a female, little did I know that this was actually his ""signature"" appearance. Again, this is something that you do not know about the man while simply watching his films. If you want to experience Izzard for the first time, I think any of his one-man routines would be of help. Like a bottle of fresh wine, my wife and I chose Dress to Kill as our first sip of Izzard. I suppose it is as good as anywhere to begin. So, one fateful Saturday night, we popped his DVD into our player, sat ourselves down, and began the nearly two hour adventure into the mind of Eddie Izzard. Needless to say, I was both impressed and unimpressed all at once.Izzard's routine, like a small child dealing with ADD, was all over the place. We open Dress to Kill with an homage of sorts to the San Francisco trolley line coupled with Alcatraz. It is a random opening, which should have given us an indication of what Izzard's performance was about to transform into. With inconsistent voice-overs about the people riding the trolley to nearly annoying repetitive wording, we are swept into the auditorium finally to see Izzard in person. Dressed rather feminine, he dashes on stage and begins his bits about politics, Britain, and history. Izzard, is literally, all over the place with his comedy. Spewing bits of humor mixed with, what I would later learn as classic, mumbles, pauses, and what felt like a complete lack of focus. Don't get me wrong, there were some bits that just would make you laugh with delight. Some that I remember were the ""cake or death"", Hollywood British villains, the American way, and his classic ""yes/no"" routine. Sadly, these humorous elements nearly clashed with his random tangents, which went quickly into a fast rewind back to his memorized routine.It is obvious that Eddie Izzard is a smart man. From his routine, in which historical dates and events are obviously a excitable subject for him, you can see where his strengths and weaknesses are. His weakness, in my eyes, is the audience. It becomes abundantly clear midway through his bits that he will fall way off the subject if it is something the audience attaches itself to. In one aspect he would be discussing how the British loved to land on islands and place a flag there to call their own, the audience would laugh, he would go off on a tangent, and suddenly, ten minutes later, he would go back to that original thought. After a few times of doing this, I was annoyed. It is my belief that Izzard is a funny person by nature. He has the ability to make audiences laugh because of his eclectic style and excitement, sadly, what fails in this performance is his lack of formal comedy training. Now, I am no expert in the matter, but watching other famous comedians perform their routines, there seems to be a level of professionalism surrounding them. Watch Ray Romano, Rodney Dangerfield, or Jerry Seinfeld do their shows and you will witness a clean, crisp show which demonstrates to me that these performers actually rehearsed, rehearsed, and rehearsed again to get it right. Izzard, it was obvious, did not. Maybe he did, but in Dress to Kill it just felt like he read the newspaper one day, thought of some funny jokes, memorized a pattern, and nearly forgot it while on stage. He seemed sporadic and completely unprepared. I need to watch more Izzard, maybe this is his style, but for me, it seemed cheap and distorted.Coupled with Izzard's procrastination approach to comedy, the production value on this DVD felt like a late 80s release. I felt like I was watching an RPG game in which the camera angle goes everywhere except for the places that you instantly need it. Either the cameraman was drunk or the director just loved jumping from angle to angle. As viewers, we would find ourselves with a full shot of Izzard, then jump to a distance shot, to some random audience angle, and followed by some other random angle. We couldn't just stay in one place, but just like Izzard's routine, seemed to be all over the place with no consistency. Like most comedy DVDs, I wanted to see the audience laughing, I wanted to see more of Izzard's expressions (which, in my humble opinion, are his best traits), I wanted to see more of Izzard in general. The quality of this DVD does not enhance the quality of Izzard's show, sadly, it only seems to bring the overall production value down.Overall, if I were asked to watch another Eddie Izzard one-man stand-up routine, I would proudly say ""yes"". Perhaps this was one of his less valued tours (which is strange because it is this one that won him the most awards), but I want to give Izzard another chance. Eddie Izzard is hysterical when he works on his routine. His random interjections can be funny, but it is his well-developed jokes and commentary that really make his style of comedy stand out. I am eager to watch his ""action"" transvestite on screen and watch this ""full-of-potential"" comic develop in his career. Would I suggest this DVD to friends? I think that I would for the tasty cookies crumbled between ill-placed jokes, but I do not think I could watch Dress to Kill another time.Grade: *** out of *****",0,,ur1601212,29 January

428,0184424,"Some people loved ""The Aristocrats"" and others hated it, frequently walking out in the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard aren't likely to be that extreme -- if you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that makes, shall we say, enough use of the ""f"" word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television. Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances. On the other hand, I thought this show was occasionally flatter than Izzard's chest but also more often than not funny and, in spots, absolutely hilarious. He has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines. He's not a story teller. He's not a joke maker. He's not a frenetic fantasist like Robin Williams. He plays around with ideas, some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz, for instance -- are completely unfunny. He has a way, however, of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect. I gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8. But a 10?

435,0184424,"This show is almost historical to me. I remember coming home from work one late summer day in 1999. I had dinner, went into the living room and sat down in front of the big-screen TV. The channel happened to be on HBO but I wasn't particularly interested in watching, I mainly wanted to nap. There was a guy on TV dressed kind of unusual doing a stand-up comedy routine. I had no idea who or what it was, but the guy did seem kind of cool. As a lark I turned up the sound and watched a little. At this point I completely forgot about my nap. I started laughing. He was hilarious. Then came a skit that made me laugh so hard that I found it hard to catch my breath. Then the humor came like rapid fire, one after the other, each more unbelievably hilarious than the previous. I was laughing so uncontrollably that I started to feel pain in my lungs and started to choke, I felt like I was going to hurl! Get this; I actually had to make the reluctant decision to turn off the TV because I was afraid I was going to suffocate! I couldn't breathe, my chest was throbbing in pain; and I'm in very good shape! I couldn't help thinking that this was the Monty Python death joke in real life!

I found this to be much more more entertaining that say Martin Lawrence or Andrew Dice Clay.

The problem is, I'm as guilty as anybody else. He sucks you in. You watch it once and you laugh. You watch it again and you nod and laugh hysterically. The third, fourth, fifth time you watch it, you start saying his jokes along with him--and you STILL laugh. After a while, you start playing the CD or DVD out of habit, or when friends come over.

450,0248828,"When I first heard about this hour long film I wasn't sure if it would be an hour wasted or not. It would be my first time watching George Carlin as the comedian he became famous for. I didn't think I was ready only because I remembered Carlin only for doing the voice characterizations in Thomas and Friends (which I really liked). I was given a heads-up and was told Carlin is very crude with his humor and decided to watch for the sake of personal interest. Turns out, the whole hour I was laughing my butt off to kingdom come!George Carlin is a genius. Never have I experienced such humor before that made me laugh so hard. Although this was filmed in 1984 the jokes were still relevant in today's standards for the most part. Sure there were some that I may have not understood but besides that, I was cracking up at everything he was talking about. What made me laugh most were the different voices that Carlin made and the facial expressions he made. Sometimes he had a really high voice, while other times he had a deep scratchy voice. Along with that, his facial expressions ranged from scrunched up to googly eyed. There is only one thing I felt about this short film could have left out. Sometimes between intermissions on the set, short crude cartoons were played. Even though they were narrated by Carlin, I thought they could be done without.

So you get a grumpy George who can't do his known material in a show that he probably didn't write and thats why it didn't last long.

Action usually takes place in his apartment or in a local bar that his friend's gather at (which is sort of like Monk's as a hang-out spot in Seinfeld). I enjoy Carlin's Stand-up comedy, but he's always pretty funny when he takes on an acting job (he out-shines Bette Midler and Shelley Long in Outrageous Fortune).It would have been nice if the show lasted longer. I have one episode that I taped off the TV that I drag out to show friends. It always yields laughs. I just wish I could fine a place to buy or watch the other episodes.The comedy isn't for everyone.

461,0963207,"It might be a stretch saying this as a die-hard Carlin fan, but the material, both written and as performed, in It's Bad for Ya is some of the best late-era material yet. At 70 Carlin bounces back from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) from Life is Worth Losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful- or as much as the ""old f***"" can get- and is continuously, ceaselessly, funny. And funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching Back in Town or 'Diseased' the first time. The material, even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done (i.e. the whole bit on children in school and camp like the Children segment in Diseased), is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while (here goes) tickling the funny bone.Going from the topic of death (how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book? six weeks, unless if on the computer scheduler), the facets of communication, looking down from Heaven, spots of God (naturally), kids, and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have ""Rights"" make up the bulk of the special, centered around the premise that what's bad for you, plain and simple, is BS. Total, complete BS, which as we also learn (or if you've really learned it you're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not-quite randomly by the parent) holds the country together. Carlin isn't necessarily angry though, even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns, even just to observe how horrifying children's teeth coming in look. It's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is NOT going to be ""fine"".What it comes down to is this: Carlin is to dirty, witty, cautionary stand-up comedy what Yoda is to Jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any.

465,0963207,"George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I have seen so many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him perform live. He had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. His last 2 specials (Life is Worth Losing especially and Complaints and Grievances) have lacked a certain spirit and content. George appeared overweight, old and tired (not to mention coming out of rehab). ""I SAID NOT TO MENTION IT""! Anyway. Life is Worth Losing was especially tragic as he was overweight, disgruntled, coming off of rehab (there we go again...) and extremely unfunny. If there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without heckling him off stage, George achieved it with Life is Worth Losing. It is as if the New Millennium and Post 9/11 America was trampling George's spirit. The bs had become too large to manage.The comeback is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This special is the transmutation completed. George is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. He is in full acceptance of his age, being old and dealing with the looming prospects of death. He has accepted being a crusty old SOB and is relishing in it. This is better than his previous specials, yet far from Jammin' in New York. It is a little tragic. His observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George isn't George anymore. He is no longer criticizing us but is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how dissimilar modern life is. This is an improvement over the previous two specials, but George does not, as of yet, recoup his old glory (if ever). He has been reduced from critical social and political stinging commentary to mostly personal peeves. When he goes political, he still has something to say. It is heavily derived (especially if you have seen any of his previous work), but it still works somehow, as opposed to his random rantings which lack a certain relevance outside of the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer.For now I will worship the Sun and pray to Joe Pesci that George can recreate himself as a cutting edge septuagenarian. It's a 50/50 chance. Life seems to have become more tedious for George and his ""art"" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 specials, but is far from his old self. Where does he go from here? He may never recoup but maybe he can further metamorphosing/refine this new ornery old man routine.

468,0963207,"Carlin often railed against health nuts and hypochondriacs. In one monologue of his, he joked how as a young boy he used to swim in raw sewage in order to build up a strong immune system. In another, he denounced germaphobes, those arguably neurotic people always washing their hands. So what, referencing the title, is so bad for us? Namely, that which sets off our BS detectors. And wouldn't you know it, Carlin's own was most hypersensitive and responsive!Still, the title of this concert is rather misleading. Carlin's aforementioned trusty detector takes a long time to reveal itself. The greater portion of this has Carlin generally relaxed, low-key, making lightweight observational humor. He's certainly his crotchety old self but not quite as vitriolic as he was in other stand-up shows of his.In this, Carlin announces his age. At the time, he'd just turned 70. As such, our lovable balding curmudgeon spends a lot of time musing about death and dying. He talks about the advantages of being elderly, how easy it is to forget friends and loved ones who have passed on, as well as some of the stupid things consolers say to the bereaved. As if there's not enough stage material in this life for the guy to go on about, Carlin turns his attention to and is critical of some aspects of the afterlife, as well.It's not just oldsters that good ol' Georgey has some critical things to say about here, but youngsters too. According to the comedian, a lot of kids are losers -- failures, underachievers, incompetents -- apparently, however, just not in classrooms, at home, or on the playing field, where they are praised to no end, championed, and unanimously victorious. As for the parents of these imps, the comic lovingly condemns those who are overprotective of their sons and daughters, to the point of what he feels is borderline child abuse.Where I laughed the hardest was when Carlin gets to talking about phone conservations. Is there anything more annoying than a telephonic rambler? He instructs the audience as to the proper body language to use when dealing with a yawn-inducing windbag on the line. You don't want to be rude and just hang up on the person, after all.The last twenty minutes of IT'S BAD FOR YA! Are the best. In these, Carlin's tone changes, as the social commentator in him is finally released, with unquestioning, techno-zombies the first in line to be criticized. Then it's onto religion, with just a sprinkling of political commentary. On a more serious note, the late great George Carlin discusses the violation of human rights by governments, freedoms which he observes are shrinking as time passes.Dear Mr. Carlin.

469,0963207,"My brother got me hooked on Carlin back in the 70s. I always loved his observational humor. That is, looking at every day things and finding the humor in it, like asking the question,""Have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket? You can't do it! They keep bringing back to you!"" And asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the ""F"" word, while making prefect sense with the discussion.However, during the 90s his stuff was less funny, and more angry. What he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to society's face and say 'take a look!' At this point, his shows were less of a comedy show, and more of a gripe session. But in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense. He really made you think.Here was Carlin old and new. He starts out about the fun one could have by getting old, and later slamming the the state of the world.

Though this may not be his ""best"" work, it is excellent, funny, and thought provoking. This recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts.Throughout his long, prolific, and influential career, Carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes, towards a more 'humanitarian' viewpoint of society and culture. His focus on the English Language and euphemisms increased throughout the years, and culminates in this performance. Though, I would argue that his audio book ""When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?"" best displays his vast wit with regards to language, euphemisms, and the breakdown of our values.

477,0248828,"When I first heard about this hour long film I wasn't sure if it would be an hour wasted or not. It would be my first time watching George Carlin as the comedian he became famous for. I didn't think I was ready only because I remembered Carlin only for doing the voice characterizations in Thomas and Friends (which I really liked). I was given a heads-up and was told Carlin is very crude with his humor and decided to watch for the sake of personal interest. Turns out, the whole hour I was laughing my butt off to kingdom come!George Carlin is a genius. Never have I experienced such humor before that made me laugh so hard. Although this was filmed in 1984 the jokes were still relevant in today's standards for the most part. Sure there were some that I may have not understood but besides that, I was cracking up at everything he was talking about. What made me laugh most were the different voices that Carlin made and the facial expressions he made. Sometimes he had a really high voice, while other times he had a deep scratchy voice. Along with that, his facial expressions ranged from scrunched up to googly eyed. There is only one thing I felt about this short film could have left out. Sometimes between intermissions on the set, short crude cartoons were played. Even though they were narrated by Carlin, I thought they could be done without. They just weren't as funny as Carlin talking before. Besides that though, I had a blast with this and I'm glad was able to see it.For anyone who's not familiar with George Carlin's work, this is the film to start off with.

482,0246645,"It was only coincidence that I was watching this special the day after George Carlin died recently. I know there is a sudden rush now to see all his old stuff as if he was a relative who we never spent enough time with but for me it was just something that I had recorded and had taken my time getting round to. I'm not a massive fan of Carlin but I have seen parts of his career that I have thought were really smart, insightful and funny.Although it has its moments and plenty of energy, You Are All Diseased is not among his better word, indeed it is surprisingly weak. The only other review on this site that has pointed this out has been roundly slated via the ""useful"" voting system and I imagine it will be worse now due to talking ill of the dead but it is hard to avoid seeing the show for what it mostly is. And what that is is an angry rant that is surprisingly weak in validity and humour. I'm all for angry comedy and I think the more acerbic the better but I need to be able to understand the point being made behind it, even if the routine ends up in extreme examples, if it is built on a good point then it works.Here though too many of Carlin's rants are built on unreasonable points from the very start and it takes away from how interesting it is to listen to. It begins at the beginning with a rant against hygiene. In that he rails against the basic hygiene habits everyone should have and it risks losing him the viewer as one starts to think ""well, hang on a minute"" about what is being said. Here and there he makes really good points in his angry rant but too much of it seems to be anger for anger's sake with illogical arguments and (in some cases) hypocrisy, as the basis. What is worse is that a lot of the humour seems dependant wholly on swearing, shock value and energy to carry it. Of course this is not wholly a criticism because he does work this angle really well and the crowd do love him for it, just for me I was laughing at this and I didn't think the crowd were so much as they were ""reacting"" to the delivery.Carlin may be gone but he has left behind him some very work from his career; problem here is that I don't consider You Are All Diseased is among it.

Carlin says it best when America's leading industry is the quality and manufacture of bullshit USDA Prime Cut!

497,0249854,"This is George's first HBO Special from 1977 - ""On Location with George Carlin""... his earliest concert performance available on video. He is playful from the very start. Even before he has spoken, he tries to get laughs from the mic lead. He doesn't seem completely comfortable, and talks about being nervous - which seem quite genuine. A new phase of his career is starting... after the age of 40! He begins as gently as he can, with observations of shared modern life. The comedy of common experience. Stuff he's done on his albums, which he knows is reliable, and very audience-friendly. He clearly feels the need to get off to a solid start. He tries so hard to be visually funny that his mimes are probably too exaggerated, and to me sometimes distract from the material. Not everything he does works, but the encouraging audience lets him miss a few times as long as keeps trying to come back with another hit.Unfortunately, some of the observations seem inane to me in 2005. Dogs and cats! I ask you. I suppose it's not his fault that subject has been done to death since then... to such a degree to make that a comedy cliché in itself. In the middle of the show, George takes time out to do his contrived news items - showing his mastery of set-up punchline jokes.What George Carlin also does that no other comedian has done to such a degree is to analyse language. Not just phrases, but individual words. And things like oxymorons (look it up if you don't know what it means!). The stuff that flies by in our daily lives, that we all accept without thinking about it. There in practiser we have a principle that George talks about when describing how to create comedy - ""Anything we ALL know about, nut NEVER talk about... is FUNNY.""

He begins his routine by immediately going political: about the Persian Gulf War, he says, ""It's first war we've had that was on every news channel, plus cable. We like war because we're a war-like people (...) We're good at it. And it's a good thing we are, we're not very good at anything else anymore!"" With this he begins his attack on how we as a nation can bomb other countries, especially ""brown people"" (except Germans, and only because they were trying to 'cut in on our action.'). He talks about being his own person, someone who thinks for himself, and about how war is about ""prick-waving"" and nothing else. And seeing it today as yesterday it makes sense: all he's pointing the finger at is on the general situation and where we're headed, and no one is better than he in making war as a concept a sexual thing and an issue of manhood.But he soon gets the political stuff out of the way, and goes into dissertations on embarrassing situations -- the trivial things we go through -- which are flat-out funny. No one better than Carlin to talk about how when there are times when you're coming up the stairs and think there is one extra step, or when you've woken up and not known which day it was. And of course, his forte: language, and our misuse or over use of it for things that don't need such technicality. Who better than he to talk about the minutiae of airplane instructions?

503,0246643,"Truth be told, I don't watch George Carlin in order that I might succumb to a few chortles, but because I've always admired this man's incisive and forthright social commentary, which was usually spot-on. This guy knew how to tell it like it is. It is what made this particular stand-up comedian so unique. GC was not just about making his audience laugh. Any personified whoopee cushion atop a stage can do that. Carlin has been dubbed the thinking man's comic, and rightly so.I was curious to see how much of Carlin's material in JAMMIN' IN NEW YORK has stood the test of time and so re-viewed it in order to find that out. Much to my surprise, very little of it is outdated. About the only talk that is is the stuff about war in the Persian Gulf. This was one of his earlier live events, back when men wore pleated pants and ponytails. The latter happens to be a pet peeve of mine, but I digress.In the news of late, in certain parts of the globe, is this politicized clampdown on -- forget political graft, deceit, and corruption for a moment -- plastic of all things, which brings to mind one of the monologues contained here, titled ""The Planet Is Fine."" Very timely, this.Carlin also goes on about syntax and the hairsplitting of terminology as it applies to air travel, and as one who chooses to occasionally ignore conventional grammar himself for common sense, this bit was both identifiable and much appreciated.Superfluous wording. Ah, yes. Carlin notes how some people prefer to use highfalutin terms in order to make something sound more important than it actually is. Like the other week when I passed by a ""hydration station"" (i.e. water cooler). A mouth-watering term to any language-loving enunciator, but needlessly uppity-sounding to say the least.There is some constructive criticizing of the government, which is what democratic dissent is all about. The part about how those in power often seek to divide the people is something very few comics would go into, but Carlin does. He also has some unflattering things to say about environmentalists.Not every joke or observation goes over well. At least not with me. As one who likes to golf, I found Carlin's derisive remarks in regard to this particular pastime way off the mark. But considering we're both into free speech, I would rather he be free to voice erroneous and unfunny comments from time to time than be censored.Incidentally, I think Carlin's incorrect when he says that the term pre-recorded is a redundancy. This HBO special, for instance, was recorded in real time whereas, say, episodes of televised sitcoms are usually recorded beforehand, to be aired at a later date -- that is to say, they are pre-recorded. Getting analytical here, I know. Just saying.Overall, JAMMIN' IN NEW YORK is quite groovy and for the most part remarkably dateless. I can do without all the observational humor and there is some of that here as well. Carlin is at his best whenever he's on a riff or a rant and the least interesting when he resorts to body English and the making of funny faces. But I suppose some in the audience who are only amused by slapstick-like fare would find this entertaining and such ones are not left out from enjoying the show.

Most of the content in Hard Knock Wife is centered around child birth and motherhood which at times gets tiresome.

523,0079807,"Richard Pryor: Live in Concert (1978) **** (out of 4)This Richard Pryor concert film was recorded at the Terrace Theatre in Long Beach, Califorinia. Obviously, when it comes to comedy, getting a laugh is a very subjective thing so you're going to know whether or not you find a comedian to be funny. To me, Pryor is without question the greatest stand up comic in the history of comics. Am I overselling him? I personally don't think so because there was never anyone quite like him and no one that has followed has been able to match him.This comedy special will certainly have tears rolling down your face as he starts off in a frantic pace and just continues that throughout the running time. I'm certainly not going to ruin specific jokes here because when I say them they're obviously not nearly as funny. The freshness of the material still manages to leap off the screen all of these years later and it really does show you how far ahead of time Pryor and his style was.There are countless hilarious moments scattered throughout the running time but what has always amazed me was the way Pryor could carry on conversations within several characters. Take, for example, the scene where he's talking about his monkeys dying and the neighbors dog came to visit him. THe way he carries on these conversation was just priceless. Speaking of the monkeys, this entire story is one of the funniest that Pryor ever delivered. Countless other subjects ranging from race to sex to even a fight with Ali are discussed in a hilarious fashion. I will say that the first hour of this is without question some of the greatest concert footage that you're going to see with Pryor. He's just off the charts as he goes from one story to the next and there will be tears running down your face from laughing. There's a very minor drag towards the end but things once again pick up and by the time the show is over you can't help but think that you've seen something quite special.",0,,ur13134536,10 January 2017,0,,180,140,5.961111111111111,0.7777777777777778,"('pryor', 7)('time', 4)('concert', 3)('going', 3)('one', 3)('running', 3)('richard', 2)('obviously', 2)('comedy', 2)('youre', 2)","['richard', 'pryor', 'live', 'concert', 'richard', 'pryor', 'concert', 'film', 'recorded', 'terrace', 'theatre', 'long', 'beach', 'califorinia', 'obviously', 'comes', 'comedy', 'getting', 'laugh', 'subjective', 'thing', 'youre', 'going', 'know', 'whether', 'find', 'comedian', 'funny', 'pryor', 'without', 'question', 'greatest', 'stand', 'comic', 'history', 'comics', 'overselling', 'personally', 'dont', 'think', 'never', 'anyone', 'quite', 'like', 'one', 'followed', 'able', 'match', 'himthis', 'comedy', 'special', 'certainly', 'tears', 'rolling', 'face', 'starts', 'frantic', 'pace', 'continues', 'throughout', 'running', 'time', 'im', 'certainly', 'going', 'ruin', 'specific', 'jokes', 'say', 'theyre', 'obviously', 'nearly', 'funny', 'freshness', 'material', 'still', 'manages', 'leap', 'screen', 'years', 'later', 'really', 'show', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'pryor', 'style', 'wasthere', 'countless', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'scattered', 'throughout', 'running', 'time', 'always', 'amazed', 'way', 'pryor', 'could', 'carry', 'conversations', 'within', 'several', 'characters', 'take', 'example', 'scene', 'hes', 'talking', 'monkeys', 'dying', 'neighbors', 'dog', 'came', 'visit', 'way', 'carries', 'conversation', 'priceless', 'speaking', 'monkeys', 'entire', 'story', 'one', 'funniest', 'pryor', 'ever', 'delivered', 'countless', 'subjects', 'ranging', 'race', 'sex', 'even', 'fight', 'ali', 'discussed', 'hilarious', 'fashion', 'say', 'first', 'hour', 'without', 'question', 'greatest', 'concert', 'footage', 'youre', 'going', 'see', 'pryor', 'hes', 'charts', 'goes', 'one', 'story', 'next', 'tears', 'running', 'face', 'laughing', 'theres', 'minor', 'drag', 'towards', 'end', 'things', 'pick', 'time', 'show', 'cant', 'help', 'think', 'youve', 'seen', 'something', 'quite', 'special']"
524,0079807,"It was about a year on from his death when I saw this concert film although I wasn't really mourning his loss or marking the occasion. However watching this film is as good a way as any to catch Pryor in his element when he was at his most impacting and most enjoyable. Following on from an unseen Patti LaBelle, Pryor gets down to it with very little formality and a relaxed air that seemed to immediately win over his audience. He holds them well throughout the whole show and comes across very natural; only once or twice did he seem to make weaker links that broke the flow a touch.I didn't laugh out loud as much as I expected to, which was a bit of a problem for me but for some reason I still really enjoyed the show. Perhaps the reason I wasn't laughing that much was more to do with my mood at the time (been given no credit for my good work by a global-level director who instead gave credit to a different team!) but I did still find his material amusing at worst. At first I worried that the race jokes of the opening sections would be all there was but he gradually opens it up into more general subjects. Of course it is relentlessly adult but he is certainly not gratuitous by the standard of some modern comedians who seem to rely on shock to cover for lack of laughs. His swearing gradually won me over although it is not easy to forget his later opinions on the N word when hearing him say it so often here.Overall an enjoyable show from a memorable comedian. Not always hilarious, he is consistently amusing and entertaining thanks in part to his strong stage presence and ability to work with his audience rather than just talk out into darkness.

This stand-up special was filmed in 1979 at the Terrace Theatre in Long Beach, California and Pryor is on fire, not only with his unleashed humor, but the facial expressions and body language that go with it. Throughout the entire show one experiences the audience's sustained roar of approval that never lets up for a minute except for the scant few seconds when he reveals how his squirrel monkeys died, and then he turns THAT into a comedy moment utilizing the German Shepherd that lived next door. You have to keep an eye on the front row folks who are literally melting down in helpless laughter keeping up with Pryor's manic routine. The man goes full bore for almost an hour and a half, tackling a variety of subjects with a John Wayne impression thrown in and riffs on boxers Leon Spinks and Muhammad Ali.

531,0079807,"A concert film of standup comedian Richard Pryor, recorded live at the Terrace Theatre in Long Beach, California.There are some artists who are so original, fearless and groundbreaking that they inspire and influence almost every other artist in their field who comes after them. This is how I think of Richard Pryor - the comedian's comedian. This concert showcases him at the top of his game with an electrifying performance; a nonstop riff on sex, families, racism, drugs, the police, death, pets, boxing and the great outdoors. Pryor pours everything he has into it, whether it be recreating a heart attack onstage, demonstrating the correct method for falling over when knocked out, delivering the most perfectly timed gag about a hunting rifle, or an amazing moment where he becomes a child lying about a breakage which I absolutely guarantee will have tears streaming down your cheeks. As with all great comedy, the writing and artistry behind this is seamless and invisible, almost as if Pryor just strolled on and made it all up. It's impossible to see how he moves from one topic to the next or to watch him perform for even a minute without being swept up in his rap. The man was simply a genius. The film itself epitomises his daring; nobody had ever released a major theatrical feature of a standup comedy performance before and no movie studio wanted it. Instead it was released independently, was a smash hit and went on to become one of the most successful comedy videotapes of all time.

548,4512714,"Demetri shares his latest set of low-key yet surreal observations on life and language, including: signs, pets, the origin of cheese, hot dogs, footballs, tandem skydiving, hamster-chucking, fitted sheets, elevator faux pas, prune juice, the aerodynamics of crackers, the quantification of educated guesswork, the tribulations of salads, the unique rejective qualities of volleyball, the sneakiness of color schemes, the general uncoolness of indoor sports, the management of fart jokes, the happiness of folks and nope, abracadabra versus please, business versus beeswax, parent/child resemblances in the alphabet, shoe store mirrors, expiration dates, and the proper temperature of regards.Saw the show in Madison, Wisconsin a couple weeks before the special was taped. It is very interesting to see a tour before the special, to see what jokes get thrown out, which get improved, and what else may happen. Practically nothing in this special was new from what we saw, but the best part is that some of the weakest bits were cut out. This makes the final product a couple minutes shorter, but just as funny (or funnier) the second time hearing it.My only complaint (and I may be in the minority here) is I wish the few ""adult"" jokes were removed. Not that they are not good jokes, but it seems out of sync with the brand of humor Demetri has made himself known for. He excels at quirky observations and grammar / language jabs.

Okay, this wasn't his best stand-up routine, but his observations on every day life are what made him popular, and there's much to be gleaned from this stand-up special filmed at the Beacon Theater in New York City. Jerry makes his appearance via a helicopter jump into the Hudson River right nearby, hustling to the venue because there was no place for the pilot to park. Jerry tweaks annoying friends, people addicted to texting, the postal service, and utilizes the second half of his show to expound on marital life. His bit on the invention of pop-tarts reminded me a little of the Hot Pockets guy, Jim Gaffigan, who's own routine is funnier than Jerry's, which I conclude might be a personal preference.

That helicopter stunt was pointless but admittedly pretty cool, especially considering his age.4. 99% of this standup special will be exactly what you expect it to be. So if you like Jerry Seinfeld's comedy you'll enjoy it, and if you don't really like his style, then you probably won't like this special. Thankfully, I generally enjoy his standup, and so generally enjoyed this.5. Jerry looks like he could do this in his sleep he's so natural. I won't argue he's the funniest standup comedian, but he might be one of the most skilled.

""Oh, Hello"" is unique, original, and interesting, and should be considered essential for theatre and stand-up fans. The characters of George and Gil are well executed and extremely fun to watch, and I absolutely love this special. It is one of the most quotable pieces I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, there are flaws here. The show tries to tackle a lot of different things; an interview, standup, a story, a ""ballet"", and all these elements are well meaning and pretty well executed, but sometimes, particularly during the interview, they feel a little bit like lulls in the performance. A lot of the jokes, as well, are very New York based, about specific parts of living in and being in New York city, and if you're not familiar with NYC then these might go over your head, even though they're quite poignant and funny. That being said, the elements that Kroll and Mulaney introduce here are extremely interesting and entertaining, and make the show incredibly unique and fun to watch, and if you like performance art of really any form, you'll probably enjoy this.

696,0319971,"Network: Fox; Genre: Variety, Sketch Comedy; Content Rating: TV-PG (for language and scatological humor); Available: DVD; Classification: Contemporary (star range: 1 - 4); Season Reviewed: Complete Series (2 seasons) The tombstone was built on the head of ""Cedric the Entertainer Presents"" the minute Cedric the Entertainer uttered the words ""variety show"". Many have tried to resurrect the long-dead prime-time variety show and all have failed, notably Dana Carvey in a short-lived 1998 sketch series.There are moments in ""Presents"", such as an opening dance number where the comic emerges from a troop of scantly-clad dancers, ""The Sensations"", when the show briefly hearkens back to the days of Donnie and Marie Osmond but gives it a new millennial twist. The host on stage, in front of a visible audience, doing whatever he wanted for the half hour. There is something admirable in the attempt. Much of the time however, ""Presents"" is more ""Mad TV"" with silly, grotesquely unfunny sketches filled with 4th wall breaking musical numbers. Second only to a daytime talk show (Wayne Brady knows that), nothing is quite as stifling to talent or lowering in dignity as a variety series. And the pressure to fill 22 minutes worth of slam-bang, all different, quality sketches or risk the audience changing the channel is enough to drive anyone insane. Coming off of his ""Kings of Comedy Tour"" movie, the blisteringly funny Cedric the Entertainer seems like a strange fit for a variety show. The guy , in fact, a renaissance man. He sings, he dances, and he does more than a lot of both in this show. Probably more than contemporary audiences want to see. Like his ""Kings"" co-star Bernie Mac, he is neutered to broadcast network television standards here, forced to mellow out and appeal to demographics while paired with a troop of ensemble players whom he has little chemistry with. Of the group J. B. Smoove is the funniest - often upstaging Cedric. The problem (and I hate to use that cliché) is that the Entertainer just doesn't make this show his own. He doesn't use the platform to bring us his vision, through his voice. The show was going to be canceled anyway, people just don't watch variety shows each week the way they did decades ago, he should have said ""to hell with it"" and shaped the show into whatever outrageous thing he wanted - this sure doesn't seem like it - and gone down with the ship. Instead, we've got him running through the same annoying character sketches, such as a regularly appearing Cafeteria lunch lady and a musical therapist Dr. Love. Many have tried and all have failed, so the prime-time sketch comedy series still remains an archaic genre. (Well, as of this writing Dave Chappelle has done it and done it in spades, but transporting back to when this show was running in 2002, ""Chappelle's Show"" has yet to take off). ""Presents"" is almost cringe-worthy and not worth the time except for those who want to see Cedric the Entertainer embarrassing himself and hear tire racial stereotype jokes.

705,9036126,"I have not always liked Adam Sandler's form of comedy or his movies. In fact many times I just could not understand what I was missing because I found him to be very annoying rather than funny...however I watched this out of curiosity and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.Comedy is very subjective - not every comic will appeal to every person. Sometimes comedy is funnier to you at certain points or times in your life than others. Now that I'm older I find different things funny than I used to. Adam Sandler is older now and has been a husband for many years and is a father so I think his comedy has changed as well. He has obviously matured and it seems he ""gets"" it now. Life is completely absurd and everyone and everything is annoying and you realize how truly mundane and pointless life can be. People are cruel and life can be hard, disappointing, heartbreaking and unfulfilling. As you get older you learn to cope by finding the humor in all of it. If you don't laugh...you'll cry. Therefore I found this special to be hilarious because he's poking fun and making light of everyday life and people that we have all encountered. I was laughing throughout the whole thing because it's relatable and made me feel like I'm not the only one who thinks these thoughts about stuff.Also the tribute to Chris Farley and also to his wife and kids was very touching. It made me cry. It showed me that Adam Sandler has definitely matured. It also shows you how deeply he cares about his family and friends. He seems to be very loyal. He employs family and friends. Also what other comic has ever done a tribute to someone who has been gone for almost 21 years during their own set? I've never seen that. He could have used the time to keep the focus on himself but instead he chose to honor a dear friend who he obviously loved and cared for very deeply. All I can say is - if my son had a friend like that it would touch me very deeply and make me very happy to see that his friend is keeping his memory alive way long after everyone else has forgotten about him.If I were just rating AS on his comedy maybe I wouldn't have given this a 10 because he does seem to be very tired and emotionless in many of the bits - almost like he's doing this just to satisfy his contract with Netflix BUT since this is a special there are more elements to it than just his comedy. I felt that his piano playing sidekick was funny and enjoyable to watch and of course the tributes were really a beautiful touch so therefore I'm giving this a 10 and I rarely give 10's.If you watch this and only rate it based on his comedy alone then you must be kind of heartless because the tributes alone are worth 10's.

709,9036126,"Once a breakout star of SNL, Adam Sandler has gradually become a running joke with his selection of terrible movies, going from classics like 'Billy Madison', 'Happy Gilmore' 'The Waterboy' and 'The Wedding Singer' to self-indulgent garbage like the Grown Ups franchise and regularly including best mates Rob Schneider and Kevin James in his projects.This Netflix special will go a long way to winning back Sandler's fans. It's funny (with Sandler putting on the silly voices from his early movies), dirty, clever and touching, with a compilation of stand up shows and a surprise subway appearance in its 70 minute duration.Despite being over 50, Sandler still brings out the dirty jokes amongst family stories and a bunch of funny, silly little songs (with his keyboardist Dan Bulla and a funny cameo from Schneider). The songs are so ridiculous that Sandler often cracks up over them. Sandler uses relatable, observational humour and ramps it to ridiculous levels, with sudden and unexpected punchlines. One song has Sandler playing the hero in a series of dangerous scenarios (crashing plane, runaway train, a choking old lady in a restaurant) but they all end badly because Sandler admits he has no idea what he's doing.Highlights included the ""Wallet, Phone, Keys"" rap than went viral on social media, an emotional tribute song to Chris Farley (including a brilliant electric guitar solo from Sandler and a video compilation of Farley's life) and a nice song about Sandler's wife (with the chorus ""growing old with you"").If you've ever loved Sandler, '100% Fresh' is a must watch, if only to prove Sandler's still funny after all these years.",0,,ur2862544,10 February 2019,0,1.0,166,140,6.228915662650603,0.8433734939759037,"('sandler', 9)('funny', 4)('sandlers', 3)('song', 3)('movies', 2)('like', 2)('including', 2)('schneider', 2)('silly', 2)('dirty', 2)","['breakout', 'star', 'snl', 'adam', 'sandler', 'gradually', 'become', 'running', 'joke', 'selection', 'terrible', 'movies', 'going', 'classics', 'like', 'billy', 'madison', 'happy', 'gilmore', 'waterboy', 'wedding', 'singer', 'selfindulgent', 'garbage', 'like', 'grown', 'ups', 'franchise', 'regularly', 'including', 'best', 'mates', 'rob', 'schneider', 'kevin', 'james', 'projectsthis', 'netflix', 'special', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'winning', 'back', 'sandlers', 'fans', 'funny', 'sandler', 'putting', 'silly', 'voices', 'early', 'movies', 'dirty', 'clever', 'touching', 'compilation', 'stand', 'shows', 'surprise', 'subway', 'appearance', 'minute', 'durationdespite', 'sandler', 'still', 'brings', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'amongst', 'family', 'stories', 'bunch', 'funny', 'silly', 'little', 'songs', 'keyboardist', 'dan', 'bulla', 'funny', 'cameo', 'schneider', 'songs', 'ridiculous', 'sandler', 'often', 'cracks', 'sandler', 'uses', 'relatable', 'observational', 'humour', 'ramps', 'ridiculous', 'levels', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'punchlines', 'one', 'song', 'sandler', 'playing', 'hero', 'series', 'dangerous', 'scenarios', 'crashing', 'plane', 'runaway', 'train', 'choking', 'old', 'lady', 'restaurant', 'end', 'badly', 'sandler', 'admits', 'idea', 'hes', 'doinghighlights', 'included', 'wallet', 'phone', 'keys', 'rap', 'went', 'viral', 'social', 'media', 'emotional', 'tribute', 'song', 'chris', 'farley', 'including', 'brilliant', 'electric', 'guitar', 'solo', 'sandler', 'video', 'compilation', 'farleys', 'life', 'nice', 'song', 'sandlers', 'wife', 'chorus', 'growing', 'old', 'youif', 'youve', 'ever', 'loved', 'sandler', 'fresh', 'must', 'watch', 'prove', 'sandlers', 'still', 'funny', 'years']"

715,9036126,"Watched 1/6/19I was feeling nostalgic, I was thinking about Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy. I don't know what was going on that night but I wanted a little piece of comedic comfort from my childhood. I had heard about Adam Sandler's new stand up, I also heard it was really good. This isn't a shock to me, I know if you take Sandler out of the same formulaic comedies he's been cast in since the 90's the guy can really perform. We see his depth as a performer in Punch Drunk Love but also his comedy albums are works of musical genius in their own right. Ode to My Car is still one of the funniest things I've ever heard. So I queued it up and for the next 73 minutes was taken through an unexpectedly emotional journey.Comedy is tough to review because it's too subjective. But I will say Sandler's swagger and delivery has gotten even better, his musical songs were hilarious and the entire production cuts seamlessly and cleverly through different venues and sets. We see some behinds the scenes work too, that sort of lifts the curtain on the whole thing. He does the ""I'm too old for this s--t"" act but it isn't jaded or cynical, he isn't harsh or gatekeeping, he actually doesn't punch down at all. It's still a little raunchy too, it's great comedy. His jokes have an edge but his delivery and demeanor is so humble and earnest.The laughs are consistent and I was laughing almost the entire time, but the set takes a deeply emotional turn as Sandler plays a musical tribute to one of his closest friends Chris Farley. The song made me cry, flat out I'm not ashamed or embarrassed to admit it. Chris Farley died when I was 5 years old, I didn't really discover that until I was 12? I was always watching his SNL skits and films and was so deeply influenced seeing a fellow heavy weight perform and act like he did. Sandler's tribute is naturally sad and sentimental but also musically it's beautiful and comedic. The lyric that got me was: ""We'd tell him slow down or you'll end up like Belushi and Candy. He said those guys are my heroes. That's all fine and dandy.""Adam Sandler's 100% Fresh is clearly a tongue in cheek reference to his films consistently getting low reviews, and he doesn't say one bad thing other than a joke in which his lovingly jokes about hoping the critics all die. It was sweet and funny. I'll admit I really don't watch Sandler's newer comedies. The most recent one I saw was Click but I've heard plenty about Zohan and Jack and Jill and Grown Ups and rather than contribute to the vile stuff people say about it, I just choose to not get involved. I know I'm probably not going to enjoy the flicks so I just pass on them. I don't get why so many people say he should quit or more vulgarly should ""f-----g kill himself"" it was the same deal with George Lucas. He has every reason to be bitter and rude to fans and he isn't, his stand up is just him being him. Not giving a care if people don't like it but being humble and thankful to the fans who have stuck by him over the years.I can't recommend this special enough and I am actually really excited to hopefully hear more from the ""Sand-Man,"" I hear he was cast in the upcoming Safdie Brothers film ""Uncut Gems,"" which is a promising start for his new projects.

So for comedy value, then ""Rob Schneider: Asian Momma, Mexican Kids"" was a bit of a lacking experience, and there are far better and more funny shows readily available, if you enjoy stand-up comedy.I will say that Rob Schneider does have some good things in the show, and he delivers his material well enough. But the guy is just lacking energy and on-stage-presence. He just feels like a shadow milling about on the stage telling jokes that are more-often-than-not less than funny.I am rating ""Rob Schneider: Asian Momma, Mexican Kids"" a four out of ten stars.

782,1560169,"I recently managed to catch Robin Williams' big return to HBO and I was looking forward to some typical manic humour from him, which is pretty much what he delivers. The problem is that he still needs good material to deliver in this way and there are substantial chunks of this special when the material is not as strong as he should be doing. He dabbles into political comedy but he does so in a manner that makes him come over like he is trying to do someone else's act – it just doesn't sit well with the rest of the stuff he is doing. Put with this the fact that a lot of the material he is doing is not topical – I know I saw this several months after it aired in the US but even in December 2009 some of this stuff was done and done. It is still pretty funny but it is not as hilarious as he is trying to make it, nor as funny as the audience reaction captured suggests.Likewise some of his stuff is very crude and some of the laughs seem to be coming from the stuff he is saying being shocking. Of course this is nothing need in comedy and there is always a place for those who say the unsayable but do so in a very clever and well-delivered fashion – but this is not happening here. Williams does have some great observations with this stuff but mostly he is playing it a bit too obvious and childish for my tastes. Fortunately neither the political stuff nor the crude stuff makes up the majority of the show. There are other things in here and some of them are relevant to him and personal to him; his bits on alcoholism and drugs I found very funny but also well informed and it is just a shame he could not have done more from that direction rather than miming out his bodily functions with as much regularity as he did (pun unintentional).There is one thing above all else that makes this (admittedly too long) special work though, even as it dips at times and that is the man himself. Williams manic stuff has always worked well for me and since Mork has been his trademark and there is no sign that he has lost his touch there because his delivery and work is impressive. He nails the better material with this approach and he also carries the weaker stuff, taking the audience with him even when the joke he is doing is not that funny. The only slight wobble he has in that regard is when he does quite a lot of racial/national stereotypes and accents in one tight segment – you can feel the audience not really being sure if it is something they should be laughing at, but by force of his personality alone Williams takes them with him right through that mire.Is ""Weapons"" a great comedy show? Well to be honest no, too much of the material feels a little ""base"" in its content but Williams just about holds it together by sheer will and presence. He carries the audience and the viewer through the weaker material, moving quickly and frantically to distract us and provides plenty of good laughs on the stronger material to make us focus on that. Not quite great but he is undoubtedly good at what he does.",0,,ur1002035,26 April 2010,0,,238,177,6.07563025210084,0.7436974789915967,"('stuff', 9)('material', 7)('williams', 5)('well', 4)('funny', 4)('audience', 4)('much', 3)('good', 3)('comedy', 3)('makes', 3)","['recently', 'managed', 'catch', 'robin', 'williams', 'big', 'return', 'hbo', 'looking', 'forward', 'typical', 'manic', 'humour', 'pretty', 'much', 'delivers', 'problem', 'still', 'needs', 'good', 'material', 'deliver', 'way', 'substantial', 'chunks', 'special', 'material', 'strong', 'dabbles', 'political', 'comedy', 'manner', 'makes', 'come', 'like', 'trying', 'someone', 'elses', 'act', 'doesnt', 'sit', 'well', 'rest', 'stuff', 'put', 'fact', 'lot', 'material', 'topical', 'know', 'saw', 'several', 'months', 'aired', 'us', 'even', 'december', 'stuff', 'done', 'done', 'still', 'pretty', 'funny', 'hilarious', 'trying', 'make', 'funny', 'audience', 'reaction', 'captured', 'suggestslikewise', 'stuff', 'crude', 'laughs', 'seem', 'coming', 'stuff', 'saying', 'shocking', 'course', 'nothing', 'need', 'comedy', 'always', 'place', 'say', 'unsayable', 'clever', 'welldelivered', 'fashion', 'happening', 'williams', 'great', 'observations', 'stuff', 'mostly', 'playing', 'bit', 'obvious', 'childish', 'tastes', 'fortunately', 'neither', 'political', 'stuff', 'crude', 'stuff', 'makes', 'majority', 'show', 'things', 'relevant', 'personal', 'bits', 'alcoholism', 'drugs', 'found', 'funny', 'also', 'well', 'informed', 'shame', 'could', 'done', 'direction', 'rather', 'miming', 'bodily', 'functions', 'much', 'regularity', 'pun', 'unintentionalthere', 'one', 'thing', 'else', 'makes', 'admittedly', 'long', 'special', 'work', 'though', 'even', 'dips', 'times', 'man', 'williams', 'manic', 'stuff', 'always', 'worked', 'well', 'since', 'mork', 'trademark', 'sign', 'lost', 'touch', 'delivery', 'work', 'impressive', 'nails', 'better', 'material', 'approach', 'also', 'carries', 'weaker', 'stuff', 'taking', 'audience', 'even', 'joke', 'funny', 'slight', 'wobble', 'regard', 'quite', 'lot', 'racialnational', 'stereotypes', 'accents', 'one', 'tight', 'segment', 'feel', 'audience', 'really', 'sure', 'something', 'laughing', 'force', 'personality', 'alone', 'williams', 'takes', 'right', 'mireis', 'weapons', 'great', 'comedy', 'show', 'well', 'honest', 'much', 'material', 'feels', 'little', 'base', 'content', 'williams', 'holds', 'together', 'sheer', 'presence', 'carries', 'audience', 'viewer', 'weaker', 'material', 'moving', 'quickly', 'frantically', 'distract', 'us', 'provides', 'plenty', 'good', 'laughs', 'stronger', 'material', 'make', 'us', 'focus', 'quite', 'great', 'undoubtedly', 'good']"

He's reaching into his late 50's, and yet with a few bottles of water on stage (far less than he had at his 2002 Broadway show, but I digress) he can go on a series of topics with rapid-fire energy and a clarity that is incredible. His topics range from topical to more philosophical, but not exactly in the George Carlin sense. No, he has some more 'unique' ways of talking about the human condition, such as his closing act about how human beings would go about (or mostly just talk about) creating the male and female sexual organs. Just watching and listening Williams describe in full anatomical detail like it's interior decorating is some of the funniest and sharpest material of the decade.Some of the jokes may fall flat or not connect quite as much as Williams intends, but why carp? Just around the bend will be another joke that will rip your vocal chords out and have you glad he took you along the way. No one is spared- certainly not the past president Bush and his people- and there's always a voice or a character or vulgarity waiting to come out of his head and at the audience. It's mostly masterful work by a comedian who knows what he's talking about every step of the way, even if it would appear he might trail off and never come back to what he was talking about before.

788,1560169,"As of yesterday, August 11, 2014, Robin Williams: Weapons of Self Destruction stands as the final televised comedy special by the man we'll ever see, and to leave a career off on this particular show isn't at all a bad thing. At fifty-eight years old at the time of filming this, Williams seems as energetic and zealous as ever, prancing around the stage for eighty-nine minutes, with no breaks or intermissions, showing himself as a nonstop comedic force of nature. In such a short time, Williams show himself doing great impressions, questioning life, and doing something few film roles allowed him to do - be so brazenly crude and bawdy.Despite his crudeness, Williams entices with a certain sense of wit and wordplay to his mannerisms and lectures. Williams, for one, transitions from topic-to-topic, regardless of how outlandish the previous topic was, smoothly and fearlessly, never missing a beat or interrupting himself, resulting in a lost sense of continuity. In five minutes, Williams amusingly and thoughtfully discusses wildfires, marijuana, tornadoes, and hurricanes, making easy transitions into each topic. He continues on by frequently dropping hilarious jokes, such as the commonality between a tornado and a divorce in the south is that someone inevitably loses a trailer and that the reasons Germany doesn't have any comedians or funny personalities is because they tried to kill them all decades back.Arguably the most entertaining is when Williams reminds us how asinine our recent history has been, saying that ""it's like we've been on the drug 'f*** it all' for the past eight years,"" as he recounts political events from 2000 to 2008. Through and through, Williams is entertaining as hell, spirited, clearly working off of ample amounts of energy, not fumes of it, and offering advice and keen observations at every turn. He even gives us one of the most memorable statements on marriage I've ever heard which is, ""there are penalties for early withdrawal and depositing into another account.""

The vulgarity of it all was amazing, and what was even more amazing is that it was all funny, and not many jokes fell flat at all.

I have been a longtime Robin Williams fan, but he hasn't been up to par Like I expect recently, but this here righted all of that and more.

790,1560169,"The death of Robin Williams, a beloved comedic and dramatic actor in 2014 was very hard hitting for most of his fans. People were prompted with emotion, when it was found out, that he killed himself. Looking back at it, Robin Williams: Weapon of Self-Destruction show early signs where Robin William was heading. After all, the title 'Weapon of Self-Destruction,' doesn't ring happiest. It's really hard to tell, if a comedian was indeed joking or calling for a cry for help. At the time, the jokes in here, were pretty dark, but nobody could had guess that Robin Williams would indeed act upon the things that he was preaching against. What drives people to suicide is a mystery, only the victim could answer. We, the audience could only guess what, they were thinking. You can tell that the comedian was trying to reignite his career in 2009, after several of his main lead movies in the 2000's became bombs at the box office. Becoming too much of a gamble, producers were nearly unwilling to pay the enough of money to keep Robin William as a leading man. Since then, Williams took smaller acting in smaller films to pay his bills. This may have led to money troubles. It didn't help that 2009 was a rough year for Williams. His second marriage just ended, due to citing irreconcilable differences and he had really bad heart problems. These factors force Williams to return back to his roots, and try out 'Stand up"", once more. Robin Williams did a special for HBO about his first solo TV concert since 2002 filmed at Washington D.C.'s DAR Constitution Hall on his sold-out ""Weapons of Self Destruction"" national tour. It was here that Robin covers a range of topics such as global warning, health care in America, politics, sex and others. He even put spotlight in more personal topics such as his recent open heart surgery, his past drug and alcohol abuse, and his struggle with severe depression. All the jokes were nearly all hits than misses to the funny bone to me. Still, the special was missing something. The jokes really have no pattern to them. Robin Williams really jumps around way too much here. It didn't flow right. I know that William use Free association in the past, but it was bit distracting here. Even for 2009, some of the humor was really dated as if he told them, years before. Why was he talking about the changing of the Pope in 2009? It felt like we jump back into a time machine to 2005, where that joke would had made more sense. Even the Bill Clinton humor, while mostly timeless, felt a bit odd to hear. It felt like some joke that he forgot to talk about in the 1990s. At less, he got some of his future predictions right. South America pope. Who knew, right! Some critics might hate the special due to the fact, that Williams said that this was his last chance to make jokes at the expense of the Bush administration, but by the time the show was staged, only a few minutes covered that subject. It felt a bit false advertisement. I love the fact that most of his humor in this, was for the intellectual audience. It takes a higher level of wit to make them laugh. Still, there were some stupid humor here, but it wasn't too much in bad taste or felt offending. Some critics might not like the special due to the harsh language that Robin Williams use. Anybody, who knows Robin William's previous stand up works; knows that it isn't PG. Sadly, most people know him for his work in children movies, so it's hard for certain people to give him free range in comedy. This special is definitely not appropriate for kids as it's a bit raw and raunchy. His delivery is hectic, frenetic, and hyper. You can tell with how many times, he go to the water bottles that was place for him, which occasionally become props in his act. Is it distracting? Not really, in my opinion, he still performance with the greatest of ease. I love the way, he able to use his voice to make his act felt more illuminating. The way, he created voice impressions of people, including Walter Cronkite, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Stewart, Popeye and others here were amazing. In this special, you really see, why Robin Williams is not only a great voice actor, but a great slapstick body actor. He work out a story through body motions, like a loud-mouth mime on steroids. Still, it was a bit odd to see, William stimulate sex scenes or have a talking penis. It was also pretty nice to see his ability to improv as the opening to the special, didn't really go his way, due to certain late guests. Overall: He's still one of the best in the industry, and I'll be adding this to my collection for sure. It's a must-watch for any Robin Williams fan. I do recommended it.",0,,ur34049683,13 September 2014,0,,448,303,5.680803571428571,0.6763392857142857,"('williams', 13)('robin', 12)('really', 8)('special', 7)('felt', 6)('people', 5)('still', 5)('bit', 5)('william', 4)('jokes', 4)","['death', 'robin', 'williams', 'beloved', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'hard', 'hitting', 'fans', 'people', 'prompted', 'emotion', 'found', 'killed', 'looking', 'back', 'robin', 'williams', 'weapon', 'selfdestruction', 'show', 'early', 'signs', 'robin', 'william', 'heading', 'title', 'weapon', 'selfdestruction', 'doesnt', 'ring', 'happiest', 'really', 'hard', 'tell', 'comedian', 'indeed', 'joking', 'calling', 'cry', 'help', 'time', 'jokes', 'pretty', 'dark', 'nobody', 'could', 'guess', 'robin', 'williams', 'would', 'indeed', 'act', 'upon', 'things', 'preaching', 'drives', 'people', 'suicide', 'mystery', 'victim', 'could', 'answer', 'audience', 'could', 'guess', 'thinking', 'tell', 'comedian', 'trying', 'reignite', 'career', 'several', 'main', 'lead', 'movies', 'became', 'bombs', 'box', 'office', 'becoming', 'much', 'gamble', 'producers', 'nearly', 'unwilling', 'pay', 'enough', 'money', 'keep', 'robin', 'william', 'leading', 'man', 'since', 'williams', 'took', 'smaller', 'acting', 'smaller', 'films', 'pay', 'bills', 'may', 'led', 'money', 'troubles', 'didnt', 'help', 'rough', 'year', 'williams', 'second', 'marriage', 'ended', 'due', 'citing', 'irreconcilable', 'differences', 'really', 'bad', 'heart', 'problems', 'factors', 'force', 'williams', 'return', 'back', 'roots', 'try', 'stand', 'robin', 'williams', 'special', 'hbo', 'first', 'solo', 'tv', 'concert', 'since', 'filmed', 'washington', 'dcs', 'dar', 'constitution', 'hall', 'soldout', 'weapons', 'self', 'destruction', 'national', 'tour', 'robin', 'covers', 'range', 'topics', 'global', 'warning', 'health', 'care', 'america', 'politics', 'sex', 'others', 'even', 'put', 'spotlight', 'personal', 'topics', 'recent', 'open', 'heart', 'surgery', 'past', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'struggle', 'severe', 'depression', 'jokes', 'nearly', 'hits', 'misses', 'funny', 'bone', 'still', 'special', 'missing', 'something', 'jokes', 'really', 'pattern', 'robin', 'williams', 'really', 'jumps', 'around', 'way', 'much', 'didnt', 'flow', 'right', 'know', 'william', 'use', 'free', 'association', 'past', 'bit', 'distracting', 'even', 'humor', 'really', 'dated', 'told', 'years', 'talking', 'changing', 'pope', 'felt', 'like', 'jump', 'back', 'time', 'machine', 'joke', 'would', 'made', 'sense', 'even', 'bill', 'clinton', 'humor', 'mostly', 'timeless', 'felt', 'bit', 'odd', 'hear', 'felt', 'like', 'joke', 'forgot', 'talk', 'less', 'got', 'future', 'predictions', 'right', 'south', 'america', 'pope', 'knew', 'right', 'critics', 'might', 'hate', 'special', 'due', 'fact', 'williams', 'said', 'last', 'chance', 'make', 'jokes', 'expense', 'bush', 'administration', 'time', 'show', 'staged', 'minutes', 'covered', 'subject', 'felt', 'bit', 'false', 'advertisement', 'love', 'fact', 'humor', 'intellectual', 'audience', 'takes', 'higher', 'level', 'wit', 'make', 'laugh', 'still', 'stupid', 'humor', 'wasnt', 'much', 'bad', 'taste', 'felt', 'offending', 'critics', 'might', 'like', 'special', 'due', 'harsh', 'language', 'robin', 'williams', 'use', 'anybody', 'knows', 'robin', 'williams', 'previous', 'stand', 'works', 'knows', 'isnt', 'pg', 'sadly', 'people', 'know', 'work', 'children', 'movies', 'hard', 'certain', 'people', 'give', 'free', 'range', 'comedy', 'special', 'definitely', 'appropriate', 'kids', 'bit', 'raw', 'raunchy', 'delivery', 'hectic', 'frenetic', 'hyper', 'tell', 'many', 'times', 'go', 'water', 'bottles', 'place', 'occasionally', 'become', 'props', 'act', 'distracting', 'really', 'opinion', 'still', 'performance', 'greatest', 'ease', 'love', 'way', 'able', 'use', 'voice', 'make', 'act', 'felt', 'illuminating', 'way', 'created', 'voice', 'impressions', 'people', 'including', 'walter', 'cronkite', 'bill', 'clinton', 'jimmy', 'stewart', 'popeye', 'others', 'amazing', 'special', 'really', 'see', 'robin', 'williams', 'great', 'voice', 'actor', 'great', 'slapstick', 'body', 'actor', 'work', 'story', 'body', 'motions', 'like', 'loudmouth', 'mime', 'steroids', 'still', 'bit', 'odd', 'see', 'william', 'stimulate', 'sex', 'scenes', 'talking', 'penis', 'also', 'pretty', 'nice', 'see', 'ability', 'improv', 'opening', 'special', 'didnt', 'really', 'go', 'way', 'due', 'certain', 'late', 'guests', 'overall', 'hes', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'industry', 'ill', 'adding', 'collection', 'sure', 'mustwatch', 'robin', 'williams', 'fan', 'recommended']"

He uses the same concept as the Live on Broadway stand-up, but the jokes are more up to date, especially the ending which cracked me up. The older Robin Williams gets is the more toned down his act is but you can't beat his his unique writing and his amazing stage performance. Like his previous stand-up acts, he touches on political and sexual matters and he even talks about being an alcoholic and his time in rehab. Anyway, if you like me, and you've grown up watching Robin Williams movies, then his stand-up is definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: The bonus material on the DVD is excellent because you get to see Robin Williams taking his act to different states and you see some of his older work which was excellent.

Maybe it's my Australian sense of humor or maybe I expected something more akin to Lee Mack or Dave Chappelle. Unfortunately it was neither...instead it was a nervous sounding robin doing impressions of Hasidic Jews, old southerners making stupid noises and then shooting off to some completely unrelated subject like heart surgery or Obama.

However, there are two hits against it. First, his earlier one was perhaps a bit funnier and it's hard to keep ""hitting it out of the park"". There's a tendency for the fans to expect the same very high level of entertainment and it's natural they'd compare the performances like I did. Secondly, and this is particular to me, I don't particularly like jokes about drinking--especially ones that make getting drunk sound funny or cool.

818,4835636,"He has put himself in good roles through the years with films like the Rush Hour franchise, Fifth Element and more recently with Silver Linings Playbook but I believe that comedian Chris Tucker is really an underused actor. He is a guy who made a name for himself in the late 90's and who appears in Hollywood films every so often. I won't say his comedic style or humor is new because it's not. It has a Eddie Murphy vibe to it and is also like comedic talent Kevin Hart. Now in 2015 and when Chris Tucker feels like ""old news"", it's more than an odd feeling to see that Netflix has put out a live comedy film from him called Chris Tucker Live.Produced by Tucker himself and directed by Phil Joanou, Chris Tucker gives us a pretty basic comedy show about the topics of life issues including parenting and dating, Michael Jackson and what's it's like having a religious mother in his childhood.I have never been much to sit through a comedy show movie due to a lack of interest level and my attention span is not the best when I am only watching one guy alone. This TV-movie though never drags nor do we want it to end. With a running time of an hour and half, it is perfectly set up to not run long for it's audience. It is a film that makes you want to just have more of Chris Tucker.To fully appreciate this comedy special, it really basically comes down to how much you like Chris Tucker. His jokes are simple but you find yourself laughing out loud. It is not really memorable in any way and really you wonder why this was put on Netflix or a TV-movie as it's labeled. Really though it's hard not to like Chris Tucker. He is a quality guy who seems like he comes from a good family. It's nice to listen to his inspirations and really he comes off a good role model.Chris Tucker Live is basically a comedy special made for someone like me who hasn't seen most Chris Tucker films and now will want to visit them for the first time or for his die-hard fans.

I must say I was totally blown away. The jokes were original and actually really funny. I spend most of my time listening to stand up from a vast array of comedians (Jim Gaffigan, Brian Reagan, Steve Harvey, Kevin Hart (before the glam) etc) and it takes a lot, a whole lot to get me on the floor laughing - but this special actually did. Chris' impersonations are rock solid. A few topics dragged on for a while but for the most part he held it up and profanity while present was kept to ""somewhat"" of a manageable minimum.

However, if you see this special in the context of his life and current society ... his comments are brilliant at times, in the way that Chris Rock use to be. But at other times he misfires - like when he jokes about other ethnicities. It's may be borderline offensive.As such, he hasn't quite honed his material in a way that best channels his brilliance ... but for me it's clear that he'll get there.The only other critique I'd offer is that he needs to stop dragging audience members into his act. It's can be a little uncomfortable for everyone. The material is good enough on its own.If you start watching this - know that the show gets better as it goes on.

He talks about the current culture of ""woke"" but throws a shallow joke before going deeper. His obsession with such heavy topics takes away from the rest of the show. People watch comedy specials to laugh, not to feel bad about themselves.1.5/5. Feels more like a therapy session than a comedy special.

850,10575038,"After reading all of the reviews simply to see how everybody was going to interpret this special differently-I am ready to give my two cents...I (like pry many of you) watched this first and foremost to see and hear how Aziz was going to respond to the allegations against him. I read what his accuser said about him and also read other things in regards to these allegations and the conclusion I came to after reading all of the facts is that this was simply a case of someone having ""buyer's remorse"" after the date was over. The accuser did not accuse him of rape (if there had been they'd have been in court and that didn't happen). She very clearly said that she gave consent throughout their whole encounter. It was only after it was all said and done and she'd had a chance to overthink it that she started to come at it from a #metoo perspective (because that's the culture now). Rather than keep it between them she felt that somehow the whole world needed to go on a witch hunt to ruin Aziz. I think the whole thing was extremely unfortunate and I actually feel really bad for Aziz because that could've been any of us man or woman. You can only go by what is said and done in the moment. You can't read a person's mind especially if consent was given. I think it was really unfair of his accuser afterwords to then try to drag his name through the mud. His career very well could've been ruined (and I believe it kind of was because he hasn't done anything since Master of None nor does it look like he's got anything coming up) by people that did not have all the facts and just wanted to jump on the bandwagon and see somebody completely ruined strictly out of Schadenfreude or because it's in fashion now to accuse everyone whether it's warranted or not. Especially celebrities- because trust if Aziz had not been famous and this had just been some other regular ""Joe blow"" that this accuser had hooked up with nobody would have heard a thing about it because there would've been no benefit to the accuser and no notoriety or fame. I never understood (after I read all the facts) why this was even a thing but because the culture was so sensitive at the time he got lumped in with all these other seriously messed up individuals. I was just glad to see that he actually had a special coming out again and I'm glad that he did recover. If you did any reading about any other actor's responses regarding the allegations-there were many people in Hollywood who supported him but they also knew that if they did that openly they'd be vilified for taking the side of someone his accuser so clearly did not want anybody to side with that their comments weren't out right that they supported him but rather they felt that he got mixed up in something unfortunate. So I feel that honestly a lot of people are confused as to what the heck this individual was trying to accomplish. She knew it wasn't rape but she wasn't completely satisfied with things so she decided to throw him to the wolves for some kind of retribution for some imagined slight done to her. I think if anything Aziz would've been justified in suing her for making him look really bad for no reason.All that being said comedy is very subjective. There are some people who think that certain comics are hilarious and I don't think they're funny at all so it's all down to personal preference. I personally find Aziz hilarious because his expressions are funny and he makes sarcastic and snide comments about things that I feel I would be making if I was in the same situations. So I do think he's funny and I really felt that he handled this the best way that he could. Obviously he had to address the allegations otherwise people would be saying ""What the heck why didn't he say anything?!"" But in this extremely culturally sensitive era we have going on now anything you say is going to be ripped apart so even if you're speaking from your heart people are going to accuse you of being dishonest or not saying enough or saying too much. There's really only so much he could've said and the best that we can hope for is that he has learned something from this and that he's going to grow and make changes going forward-which it obviously seems like he has. His career was put on hold and he didn't really make any big waves nor was he really seen much out in public since the allegations. He kind of went into hiding and no one knew what the heck was going on with him which was probably smart because people are merciless and no matter what he would've said or done it would've been picked apart so it was probably smart for him to stay off the radar until a lot of this blew over.I personally feel the way that he had some serious parts was really brave because in this day and age nobody wants to face serious things. They just want to laugh everything off and not get too deep but he made good use of a captive audience by having them stop to think about some things that maybe they wouldn't on their own. So I really feel that he did a good job with that. He could've just gotten up there and said ""Oh yeah this happened blah blah blah now let's move on and have a good night"" but he kept coming back to making people think about things they say and do so he's obviously learned a lesson.I honestly don't think he could've done this any better. Plus I was laughing out loud the entire time and I find very few comedians or people in general truly funny so for me the bar is really high to make me laugh.I loved how he had that bit where he asked people if they had heard about the swastika on the pizza and there were people that were responding that they had when in fact he just made it up. It just goes to show you that people will believe anything and go along with anything whether it's true or not. And I also love that he addressed the whole ""woke"" thing because I think that our country has gotten really ridiculous with that so somehow if you're not doing that 24/7 you're just an awful evil person who should be destroyed so it was nice to see him call that out for what it is.I can't think of one negative thing about the special except for the father who brought his 10-year-old son to the show to sit in the front row. That right there kinda sums up one of the things that's wrong with our country-not an appropriate place to take a kid and I think that Aziz was trying to hint at that in a small way by saying that the dad was putting him in a bad position because (since the Dad wasn't being a good parent) he felt he needed to tailor/alter his routine knowing a child was in the audience. That's a tough spot to be in.I can't say I would recommend this for everyone because again comedy is subjective BUT I felt it was very well done. I also have to agree with the rest of the reviews stating that the special kind of reminded them of David Chapelle's comedy because from the title of my review this Aziz comedy special is now my second favorite behind David Chapelle's Killing Them Softly and I'm a huge comedy fan so that's saying a lot.Good job Aziz.

Another aspect that made it difficult to watch was Aziz technique with his voice - he went from whispering to yelling really loudly and it was super annoying to turn the volume up and down.The special starts out with an honest account of the drama in his life this year, once he got that out of the way I found it ironic that several of his topics were about other news stories of people that offended others. Since he had a story in the news himself I found it odd that he focused much of his show on similar situations news stories of other people.

And above all, extreme compassion towards all our frailties, misunderstandings, misgivings, missteps.

This is a more personal concert one, too, Pryor reflecting, home truth and life experiences, whether drugs, whatever. He also brings up the clap, and potters around with it, exorcising it in classic Pryor style, even taking it up a notch, by adding 'black' to it.

This includes suicide, torture, sleeping with dead things and in one of the funniest bits he goes off on seeing obese people together.It's funny watching this eleven years after it was released and seeing just how brilliant Carlin was. The legend would die three years after this was released so he didn't get to see the current human nature and there's a priceless joke here about PC liberals that is just so more truer today then when he said it. Not to mention the obesity rates in America.Carlin comes out on fire with one of the fastest monologues that you're ever going to hear.

891,0484855,"I don't know what it was, maybe it was going through some of his own trials and tribulations (addiction and rehab), but George Carlin seems to be, well, different this time around. In a way I should've expected this- I remember reading a couple of years back when he was planning the special that it would be more based around language (if nothing else he is the single greatest linguist in the history of post-modern stand-up), and on that level the special isn't a disappointment. There are three things, however, that make the film not necessarily bad or over-wrought, but just, well, different, like a musician or band we all know through and through trying a little something new. This time, with Life is Worth Losing, there is a lot more philosophy in some ways, and also a little bit of loss in some of the timing for a few good laughs.The first thing is that his delivery is a little different; usually it'll seem like he'll go for his three topics (the little things in life 'Seinfeld' style, words and expressions, and the ""big"" world), but much of the special this time is with a delivery that doesn't (at least some of the time, maybe not for the most part maybe so) have that much of the same strange skepticism. The second thing is that he changes the structure around one base topic, suicide, and one wonders if this will be for the entire length or if there will be a switch to another topic or not. There's variations on the theme, sometimes it spreads out into the gripes of America, and it's always fascinating, but maybe not as hilarious as one might expect (sometimes it's more like ironic musings than full-our jokes). The third thing is that at times he is so into giving a lyrical, sometimes even poetic kind of rhythm to his bits and terms in his linguist way (the first five minutes of the special a great warm-up, is a keeper) that might throw people off. In a way he is even angrier than he was in what I think is one of his very best specials, You Are All Diseased, because this time his anger is loaded at present day subjects which are, quite frankly, infuriating.As some might come to think, I might be saying all this to shadow over thinking that the special just wasn't as funny as his best stuff. It's not necessarily that. At times I was in the same practically non-stop laughs at a few minutes a clip. As a Carlin fan all these rants that end up not leading to the same kinds of routines and such is in a way refreshing even as it is a little odd. At times I almost wondered if he was returning to a little of the spirit of his act back in the 70's mixed with his now usual brand of old-man brilliant wit and observance of all things in the world. He even seems to be going past just plain old cynicism. There is so much truth in the special at times it's kind of staggering. And to see that in such abundance and forming out into such tangents reminds me why I keep coming back to his best stuff. I'm just not sure after seeing this right off the bat that it's him at his total best, it's almost as if he's in a transition now into a totally new part of his career. Still, it's worth it to hear some of his classic takes of end of the world scenarios, the 'fat' situation in the US, and things involving suicide TV. And those last fifteen minutes are very poignant.",0,,ur0453068,5 November 2005,0,,289,212,5.809688581314879,0.7335640138408305,"('special', 6)('little', 6)('time', 5)('maybe', 4)('way', 4)('things', 4)('one', 4)('might', 4)('times', 4)('even', 4)","['dont', 'know', 'maybe', 'going', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'addiction', 'rehab', 'george', 'carlin', 'seems', 'well', 'different', 'time', 'around', 'way', 'shouldve', 'expected', 'remember', 'reading', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'planning', 'special', 'would', 'based', 'around', 'language', 'nothing', 'else', 'single', 'greatest', 'linguist', 'history', 'postmodern', 'standup', 'level', 'special', 'isnt', 'disappointment', 'three', 'things', 'however', 'make', 'film', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'overwrought', 'well', 'different', 'like', 'musician', 'band', 'know', 'trying', 'little', 'something', 'new', 'time', 'life', 'worth', 'losing', 'lot', 'philosophy', 'ways', 'also', 'little', 'bit', 'loss', 'timing', 'good', 'laughsthe', 'first', 'thing', 'delivery', 'little', 'different', 'usually', 'itll', 'seem', 'like', 'hell', 'go', 'three', 'topics', 'little', 'things', 'life', 'seinfeld', 'style', 'words', 'expressions', 'big', 'world', 'much', 'special', 'time', 'delivery', 'doesnt', 'least', 'time', 'maybe', 'part', 'maybe', 'much', 'strange', 'skepticism', 'second', 'thing', 'changes', 'structure', 'around', 'one', 'base', 'topic', 'suicide', 'one', 'wonders', 'entire', 'length', 'switch', 'another', 'topic', 'theres', 'variations', 'theme', 'sometimes', 'spreads', 'gripes', 'america', 'always', 'fascinating', 'maybe', 'hilarious', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'sometimes', 'like', 'ironic', 'musings', 'fullour', 'jokes', 'third', 'thing', 'times', 'giving', 'lyrical', 'sometimes', 'even', 'poetic', 'kind', 'rhythm', 'bits', 'terms', 'linguist', 'way', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'special', 'great', 'warmup', 'keeper', 'might', 'throw', 'people', 'way', 'even', 'angrier', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'specials', 'diseased', 'time', 'anger', 'loaded', 'present', 'day', 'subjects', 'quite', 'frankly', 'infuriatingas', 'might', 'come', 'think', 'might', 'saying', 'shadow', 'thinking', 'special', 'wasnt', 'funny', 'best', 'stuff', 'necessarily', 'times', 'practically', 'nonstop', 'laughs', 'minutes', 'clip', 'carlin', 'fan', 'rants', 'end', 'leading', 'kinds', 'routines', 'way', 'refreshing', 'even', 'little', 'odd', 'times', 'almost', 'wondered', 'returning', 'little', 'spirit', 'act', 'back', 'mixed', 'usual', 'brand', 'oldman', 'brilliant', 'wit', 'observance', 'things', 'world', 'even', 'seems', 'going', 'past', 'plain', 'old', 'cynicism', 'much', 'truth', 'special', 'times', 'kind', 'staggering', 'see', 'abundance', 'forming', 'tangents', 'reminds', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'best', 'stuff', 'im', 'sure', 'seeing', 'right', 'bat', 'total', 'best', 'almost', 'hes', 'transition', 'totally', 'new', 'part', 'career', 'still', 'worth', 'hear', 'classic', 'takes', 'end', 'world', 'scenarios', 'fat', 'situation', 'us', 'things', 'involving', 'suicide', 'tv', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'poignant']"

895,0484855,"At this point, I don't think a Carlin stand-up show needs to be non-stop hilarity. I think after so, so many years of making us laugh, Carlin should be allowed to express his opinions in the context of a pretty funny comedy show. Carlin is one of the greatest speakers of our time, and even if he has lost a bit of his incomparable delivery power with age, the man's edgy, brilliant wit and mastery of the English language is inspiring and still a complete joy to listen to.""Life is Worth Losing"" is certainly funny. Only George Carlin could make topics like suicide, genocide, and cannibalism as funny as he does here. This is because although the humor here might just be way too much for some people to take, Carlin is a remarkable writer and speaker and his material is astonishing in its strength. For instance, the 'Extreme Human Behavior' bit, while it is mostly just a rant, not a joke, George is no average human ranting- he is a genius when it comes to the usage of the English language.""Human beings will do anything, anything. I am convinced. That's why when all those beheadings started in Iraq it didn't bother me. A lot of people here were horrified, ""Whaaaa, beheadings!"" What, are you fu*king surprised? Just one more form of extreme human behavior. Besides, who cares about some mercenary civilian contractor from Oklahoma who gets his head cut off? F*ck 'em. Hey Jack, you don't want to get your head cut off? Stay the f*ck in Oklahoma. They ain't cuttin' off heads in Oklahoma, far as I know. But I do know this: you strap on a gun and go struttin' around some other mens country you better be ready for some action Jack. People are touchy about that sort of thing. And let me ask you this... this is a morale question, not rhetorical, I am looking for the answer: what is the morale difference between cuttin' of one guys head, or two, or three, of five or ten - and dropping a big bomb on a hospital and killing a whole bunch of sick kids? Has anybody in authority given you an explanation of the difference? Now, in case you're wondering why I have a certain interest, or fascination lets call it, with torture and beheadings and all of those things I have mentioned, is because each of these items reminds me in life over and over again what beasts we human beings really are. When you get right down to it human beings are nothing more than ordinary jungle beasts. Savages. No different from the Cro Magnon people who lived twenty five thousand years ago. No different. Our DNA hasn't changed substantially in a hundred thousand years. We're still operating out of the lower brain. The reptilian brain.Fight of flight. Kill or be killed. We like to think we've evolved and advanced because we can build a computer, fly an airplane, travel underwater, we can write a sonnet, paint a painting, compose an opera. But you know something? We're barely out of the jungle on this planet. Barely out of the fu*king jungle. What we are, is semi-civilized beasts, with baseball caps and automatic weapons.It's not just about being funny at this point. Carlin has been there and done that. There is certainly place for a monologue like that in a stand-up show.8/10",0,,ur11842025,29 April 2007,0,,285,224,5.992982456140351,0.7859649122807018,"('carlin', 6)('human', 5)('funny', 4)('people', 4)('think', 3)('years', 3)('one', 3)('like', 3)('beings', 3)('beheadings', 3)","['point', 'dont', 'think', 'carlin', 'standup', 'show', 'needs', 'nonstop', 'hilarity', 'think', 'many', 'years', 'making', 'us', 'laugh', 'carlin', 'allowed', 'express', 'opinions', 'context', 'pretty', 'funny', 'comedy', 'show', 'carlin', 'one', 'greatest', 'speakers', 'time', 'even', 'lost', 'bit', 'incomparable', 'delivery', 'power', 'age', 'mans', 'edgy', 'brilliant', 'wit', 'mastery', 'english', 'language', 'inspiring', 'still', 'complete', 'joy', 'listen', 'tolife', 'worth', 'losing', 'certainly', 'funny', 'george', 'carlin', 'could', 'make', 'topics', 'like', 'suicide', 'genocide', 'cannibalism', 'funny', 'although', 'humor', 'might', 'way', 'much', 'people', 'take', 'carlin', 'remarkable', 'writer', 'speaker', 'material', 'astonishing', 'strength', 'instance', 'extreme', 'human', 'behavior', 'bit', 'mostly', 'rant', 'joke', 'george', 'average', 'human', 'ranting', 'genius', 'comes', 'usage', 'english', 'languagehuman', 'beings', 'anything', 'anything', 'convinced', 'thats', 'beheadings', 'started', 'iraq', 'didnt', 'bother', 'lot', 'people', 'horrified', 'whaaaa', 'beheadings', 'fuking', 'surprised', 'one', 'form', 'extreme', 'human', 'behavior', 'besides', 'cares', 'mercenary', 'civilian', 'contractor', 'oklahoma', 'gets', 'head', 'cut', 'fck', 'em', 'hey', 'jack', 'dont', 'want', 'get', 'head', 'cut', 'stay', 'fck', 'oklahoma', 'aint', 'cuttin', 'heads', 'oklahoma', 'far', 'know', 'know', 'strap', 'gun', 'go', 'struttin', 'around', 'mens', 'country', 'better', 'ready', 'action', 'jack', 'people', 'touchy', 'sort', 'thing', 'let', 'ask', 'morale', 'question', 'rhetorical', 'looking', 'answer', 'morale', 'difference', 'cuttin', 'one', 'guys', 'head', 'two', 'three', 'five', 'ten', 'dropping', 'big', 'bomb', 'hospital', 'killing', 'whole', 'bunch', 'sick', 'kids', 'anybody', 'authority', 'given', 'explanation', 'difference', 'case', 'youre', 'wondering', 'certain', 'interest', 'fascination', 'lets', 'call', 'torture', 'beheadings', 'things', 'mentioned', 'items', 'reminds', 'life', 'beasts', 'human', 'beings', 'really', 'get', 'right', 'human', 'beings', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'jungle', 'beasts', 'savages', 'different', 'cro', 'magnon', 'people', 'lived', 'twenty', 'five', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago', 'different', 'dna', 'hasnt', 'changed', 'substantially', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'years', 'still', 'operating', 'lower', 'brain', 'reptilian', 'brainfight', 'flight', 'kill', 'killed', 'like', 'think', 'weve', 'evolved', 'advanced', 'build', 'computer', 'fly', 'airplane', 'travel', 'underwater', 'write', 'sonnet', 'paint', 'painting', 'compose', 'opera', 'know', 'something', 'barely', 'jungle', 'planet', 'barely', 'fuking', 'jungle', 'semicivilized', 'beasts', 'baseball', 'caps', 'automatic', 'weaponsits', 'funny', 'point', 'carlin', 'done', 'certainly', 'place', 'monologue', 'like', 'standup']"

Carlin continues to be the master observer of all that is good and evil and twisted in the world. He opened this set with an extremely long poem about himself, utilizing every pop-cliché that we have become accustomed to hearing these days and has a way of making most of these clichés sound banal and silly. Carlin also does something in this special that I liked that he rarely does: he referenced a joke from an earlier concert because he got mail from people who didn't understand it and chose to explain it here. You don't see that often. This show, like all of Carlin's shows, is scathingly accurate and roll-on-the-floor funny, but this one seems to have a darker theme floating over it than most of his shows.

898,0484855,"As someone who's seen a couple of George Carlin shows and thought them hilarious, this stand-up special was utterly dismal. I admire George Carlin's attempts at misanthropic social commentary and humor, but this show was way too heavy on misanthropy and almost empty on humor. Carlin does not make any jokes or punchlines at all, nor does he attempt to make any humorous statement in what can only be called an ugly and hateful rant. His waxes rhapsodic about suicide rates and sexual perversions, but only describes them, with no attempt to make jokes about them or connect these morbid topics with the audience, much less himself. In order to be funny, he would have to connect his topics with a joke, or at least make some flippant remark that the audience could find ironic or cheeky. Good satire looks for irony in their topics, and Carlin just describes his topics without connecting them to the greater sphere of the human experience, with the irony serving to make the comment humorous. Carlin doesn't try at all to be funny; he just harangues and blathers on. Carlin's laziness is apparent and frankly insulting; misanthropy is a wonderful topic for a humorist to focus on, but in order to be entertaining, it must be FUNNY! That is why misanthropes like Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain are still read and beloved today. Carlin's rants have no point other than to vent his frustrations and shock his audience. It is pathetic and saddening, as Carlin now appears to be in the twilight of his career. This is an inauspicious end for one of the best humorists of the twentieth century.

901,0484855,"Extremely few comedians are successful, even fewer for more than a year or two and the majority of those few that are still working the large venues, who prove themselves to be other than just some flash-in-the-pan dressed up in an ill-fitting suit of success by an aggressive publicity team and a gullible, entertainment starved audience; usually build their careers on one or two jokes that they've turned into their shtick: they have a quirky personality that is charming or, at least, familiar. Essentially they're one-trick-ponies with long legs. This isn't something I was really thinking about in much detail until I watched the exception to all these rules: George Carlin in Life Is Worth Losing. Here is a man who is nearing seventy years old (as of this writing), his fiftieth year in show business and he presents us with his finest, most polished work of all. He is one of those exceptionally rare breeds, in any given professional field, who not only improves with time, but substantially so to an extent that you clearly see all of his work until now has been the foundation for the masterpiece he offers us now. Not one to be particularly impressed by the vast majority of so-called ""great"" things, it took me a while after my first viewing of Life Is Worth Losing to absorb what I had seen and several repeated viewings shortly thereafter to understand I was witnessing a truly great comedian, a genius, THE master of his craft. In a world where the vast majority of ""great entertainment"" is hyped up bullsh*t and mediocrity, a passing fad at best that sours on your second taste if not turning bitterly toxic, George Carlin is a man who shows us what real, adult comedy should be: a mixture of cleverly constructed fun and intelligent material that makes you think about our comically tragic existence. This is George's best performance and material so far, his most thoughtful, thought out, thought provoking and heartfelt.I really expected to see and hear universal applause and praise for this great work. Instead, I was surprised to hear and read so many negative reviews about this masterpiece. Surely these can't be the same George Carlin fans who loved his work before. Especially those who said this work was ""bitter"". If anything I found his latest offering to be a lot less angry than most of his previous work and more thoughtful. Then I realized what all the fuss was about: in this performance George is holding up the biggest mirror he's held up so far. He's forcing more Americans to look (and laugh if they have the courage) at themselves than he ever has before. He leaves very few stones unturned in his satirical offering. For a start he talks about a lot of Americans right off the bat when he discusses obesity, as a third of Americans are classified as medically obese and about half of those as morbidly obese, according to the latest American Medical Association studies. He also talks about mindless consumerism. Between these two subjects he's covered the vast majority of Americans. And since Americans are becoming more dimwitted and righteous, the bulk of them will not laugh at themselves, the purpose of intelligent humor but prefer the sadistic, mean spirited ""humor"" they see on television (which George satirizes in ""The All-Suicide TV Channel"") or read in those idiotic emails too many people forward to everyone in their address book with titles like ""10 jokes about rag-heads"" or ""Stop complaining you homeless person"". (Some of these atrocious emails that preach intolerance are erroneously attributed to George Carlin but in fact are written by other people, none of whom have the courage to take credit for these awful, embarrassingly written pieces. Sources: see www.snopes.com or www.georgecarlin.com) If you watch ""Life is WorthLosing"" for just the opening and closing segments, you will see pure brilliance. The opening segment ""A Modern Man"" is a work of genius and you will be awestruck by George's mastery of the English language as well as his selection of timely material. The closing segment ""Coast to Coast Emergency"" is actually a very hopeful piece but I think too many people get confused by it because he's discussing the bitterness of the average person and is revealing that the solution to most people's unhappiness is to rid themselves of their own bitterness. Don't listen to the critics of this work, it's a fantastic piece. Typical of the vast majority of naysayers, they are really talking about themselves when they describe George as ""bitter"". It's why it is always a risk to tell the truth because most people want to kill the messenger that brings them bad news, especially when that ""news"" (intentional ignorance actually) is about themselves.This is George Carlin at his polished, intellectual best. It is a masterpiece of comic genius that you will want to add to your library and watch again and again; especially after one of those too frequently increasing moments of realizing the dumbing-down of your fellow countrymen and women is an alarming reality.",0,,ur8663513,8 October 2006,0,1.0,425,321,6.588235294117647,0.7552941176470588,"('george', 8)('work', 8)('majority', 5)('carlin', 5)('see', 5)('americans', 5)('one', 4)('vast', 4)('great', 4)('hes', 4)","['extremely', 'comedians', 'successful', 'even', 'fewer', 'year', 'two', 'majority', 'still', 'working', 'large', 'venues', 'prove', 'flashinthepan', 'dressed', 'illfitting', 'suit', 'success', 'aggressive', 'publicity', 'team', 'gullible', 'entertainment', 'starved', 'audience', 'usually', 'build', 'careers', 'one', 'two', 'jokes', 'theyve', 'turned', 'shtick', 'quirky', 'personality', 'charming', 'least', 'familiar', 'essentially', 'theyre', 'onetrickponies', 'long', 'legs', 'isnt', 'something', 'really', 'thinking', 'much', 'detail', 'watched', 'exception', 'rules', 'george', 'carlin', 'life', 'worth', 'losing', 'man', 'nearing', 'seventy', 'years', 'old', 'writing', 'fiftieth', 'year', 'show', 'business', 'presents', 'us', 'finest', 'polished', 'work', 'one', 'exceptionally', 'rare', 'breeds', 'given', 'professional', 'field', 'improves', 'time', 'substantially', 'extent', 'clearly', 'see', 'work', 'foundation', 'masterpiece', 'offers', 'us', 'one', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'vast', 'majority', 'socalled', 'great', 'things', 'took', 'first', 'viewing', 'life', 'worth', 'losing', 'absorb', 'seen', 'several', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'understand', 'witnessing', 'truly', 'great', 'comedian', 'genius', 'master', 'craft', 'world', 'vast', 'majority', 'great', 'entertainment', 'hyped', 'bullsht', 'mediocrity', 'passing', 'fad', 'best', 'sours', 'second', 'taste', 'turning', 'bitterly', 'toxic', 'george', 'carlin', 'man', 'shows', 'us', 'real', 'adult', 'comedy', 'mixture', 'cleverly', 'constructed', 'fun', 'intelligent', 'material', 'makes', 'think', 'comically', 'tragic', 'existence', 'georges', 'best', 'performance', 'material', 'far', 'thoughtful', 'thought', 'thought', 'provoking', 'heartfelti', 'really', 'expected', 'see', 'hear', 'universal', 'applause', 'praise', 'great', 'work', 'instead', 'surprised', 'hear', 'read', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'masterpiece', 'surely', 'cant', 'george', 'carlin', 'fans', 'loved', 'work', 'especially', 'said', 'work', 'bitter', 'anything', 'found', 'latest', 'offering', 'lot', 'less', 'angry', 'previous', 'work', 'thoughtful', 'realized', 'fuss', 'performance', 'george', 'holding', 'biggest', 'mirror', 'hes', 'held', 'far', 'hes', 'forcing', 'americans', 'look', 'laugh', 'courage', 'ever', 'leaves', 'stones', 'unturned', 'satirical', 'offering', 'start', 'talks', 'lot', 'americans', 'right', 'bat', 'discusses', 'obesity', 'third', 'americans', 'classified', 'medically', 'obese', 'half', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'according', 'latest', 'american', 'medical', 'association', 'studies', 'also', 'talks', 'mindless', 'consumerism', 'two', 'subjects', 'hes', 'covered', 'vast', 'majority', 'americans', 'since', 'americans', 'becoming', 'dimwitted', 'righteous', 'bulk', 'laugh', 'purpose', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'prefer', 'sadistic', 'mean', 'spirited', 'humor', 'see', 'television', 'george', 'satirizes', 'allsuicide', 'tv', 'channel', 'read', 'idiotic', 'emails', 'many', 'people', 'forward', 'everyone', 'address', 'book', 'titles', 'like', 'jokes', 'ragheads', 'stop', 'complaining', 'homeless', 'person', 'atrocious', 'emails', 'preach', 'intolerance', 'erroneously', 'attributed', 'george', 'carlin', 'fact', 'written', 'people', 'none', 'courage', 'take', 'credit', 'awful', 'embarrassingly', 'written', 'pieces', 'sources', 'see', 'wwwsnopescom', 'wwwgeorgecarlincom', 'watch', 'life', 'worthlosing', 'opening', 'closing', 'segments', 'see', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'opening', 'segment', 'modern', 'man', 'work', 'genius', 'awestruck', 'georges', 'mastery', 'english', 'language', 'well', 'selection', 'timely', 'material', 'closing', 'segment', 'coast', 'coast', 'emergency', 'actually', 'hopeful', 'piece', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'get', 'confused', 'hes', 'discussing', 'bitterness', 'average', 'person', 'revealing', 'solution', 'peoples', 'unhappiness', 'rid', 'bitterness', 'dont', 'listen', 'critics', 'work', 'fantastic', 'piece', 'typical', 'vast', 'majority', 'naysayers', 'really', 'talking', 'describe', 'george', 'bitter', 'always', 'risk', 'tell', 'truth', 'people', 'want', 'kill', 'messenger', 'brings', 'bad', 'news', 'especially', 'news', 'intentional', 'ignorance', 'actually', 'themselvesthis', 'george', 'carlin', 'polished', 'intellectual', 'best', 'masterpiece', 'comic', 'genius', 'want', 'add', 'library', 'watch', 'especially', 'one', 'frequently', 'increasing', 'moments', 'realizing', 'dumbingdown', 'fellow', 'countrymen', 'women', 'alarming', 'reality']"

OMG... Being in Europe now, yes there are obese ppl, but nothing like the ""interstate buses"" you see in the US, especially in the Southeastern states...And as for consumerism, while he's touched on the subject several times the ""spending money we don't have on things we don't need"" is just becoming more and more evident in society!

921,8465676,"Is there much to be said that hasn't already been said about this comedy special? Probably not, but it is a standup that is maybe seen without knowing much about it, although your conclusion on it may be affected negative or positively by this. The special is very much in two halves; the first being fairly 'standard' in approach, while the second gives over to a lot of personal and emotional content, little of which is funny, but most of which will leave a mark. It is a show that will frustrate as it satisfies - mostly with the same audience. For me I found the show a difficult watch but I had a lot of time for it. It was never as funny as I would have liked, although the laughs are intelligent and well formed. Once it moved into the more serious content I found it difficult but important to go with, and I 'enjoyed' the raw honesty of the delivery and content.It is a bit jump to it though, and references to rape and very dark imagery is not always very well bridged, but it still has an impact and keeps the viewer very much engaged. Gadsby's honesty and emotion is clear, and it makes for a challenging viewing (particularly for a straight white male such as myself); perhaps she could have reigned in the elements of attack a little to make it more accessible, but it is genuine and hard to argue with. The laughs are solid throughout, although her style means it is not side-splitting; but it is the mix of the humour with the pain that makes it work, and she passes all of it onto the viewer really well.

922,8465676,"It's fascinating how almost everyone here gives this 1 star or 10 stars, but in a way it makes sense. This is billed as a comedy special, but it goes far afield of that, which means if you don't want to follow when she veers from comedy then you'll hate it (likewise if you don't find the comedy parts funny), but it also means if you admire things that break all the rules and try to find a new way to tell stories then you're likely to be thrilled. Although I can't help but suspect there's also an element of politics in which some people are rating one star because they're offended by who she is and other people giving it 10 stars because they love who she is, with neither of these groups actually considering how this works as a piece of theater. Which, from my point of view, is quite well but not perfectly.For maybe half the show it's a very funny stand-up routine. I've never seen Gadsby before, but she's sharp and clever and genial and very good at what she does. But she's also questioning what she does, and begins to explore the ways in which comedy, in going for the laugh, can hide or distort the truth. It's not funny, but it is fascinating, and the way she tells you the story as joke in the first half then revisits the full truth of it in the second is rather amazing.But she goes beyond both comedy and deconstructing comedy. She gets into the experience of being the ""other,"" she gets into her considerable anger, and then explains why she doesn't really want to just appeal to anger, and she makes some fascinating points about art and the way we mythologize artists. At times I thought it was a little slow. At times the seriousness wore on me. But it's brilliantly structured and she's an incredibly smart and insightful woman. And she can be both very funny and searingly, powerfully emotional.In the special she says she's considering giving up stand-up. If she does, I'll be very eager to see what she replaces it with. She has a lot to say.This is well worth seeing, but if you just want to see someone telling jokes for an hour, you might want to skip this.

923,8465676,"No Matter How Boring or Hollow, Just Make It Worth Every Penny You Spent on The Ticket.Well, recently, I've found almost every show of these stand-up comedians were extremely boring and very hard to hang on to the end. It seems that the audiences suddenly lowered down their I.O., but at the same time raised their sense of humor level to their highest levels, so they could find every word of these comedians said very funny and amusing, they just could help laughing every word they said, no matter what. Gone are those great dead comedians who were really funny to the bones, and now, only these people who self-claimed they are funny, and those audiences who think their funny bones are all over their bodies, they just cannot control their laughing mechanism, they'd laugh every word of these so-called hollow comedians said, no matter what.

925,8465676,"Just how good is Hannah Gadsby in Nanette? You'll notice quite early what her onstage persona consists of; it's characterised by a tittering, uneven cadence, with variations in pitch and pauses to consider not only the audience, but also how she herself should proceed. Every now and then, she'll let out (or be unable to keep in) a nervous chuckle, as if to say: lighten up. Can't you take a joke? For the first half of her Netflix special, we're unsure of how played up this version of Hannah is. Some detractors have pointed out how unfunny or uncomedic her special is, but isn't that just trying to narrow the parametres of an artistic category that should be welcoming innovation and boundary pushing? Hannah's been categorised enough in her life, and as a gay comedian faces a perplexing dilemma: she's condemned for being lesbian, and condemned for not being lesbian enough. As if life wasn't hard enough already. For an hour or so, she commands the stage and the audience's attention, only to later walk the streets once again, being mistaken for a man, having so little power. Reports of her quitting comedy may be somewhat exaggerated, and although Hannah doesn't revolutionise the artform like some have gushed, she makes a pointed observation about the tension between comedic performance and authenticity. She hooks the audience early with her 'lesbian content', punchlines related to the tricky process of coming out that aren't uncommon, or one-liners about how parents tend to re-position their children's trauma as their own. But there's tension, and tension deflated by a laugh may be comforting, but it isn't the truth. Hannah walks us through her formative years with jokes, and then circles back to reveal the truth and shame behind those laughs. Her half-completed degree in Art History, too, begins as a feeble punchline to her accomplishments outside of comedy, but is later weaved in as bitter ammunition in her diatribe against the historical protection of powerful men's reputations at the expense of the women around them. It's at this point that some of the men in the audience start to shift uncomfortably in their seats, or turn their attention to the fascinating patterns on the walls (and admittedly, this was me to an extent). But consider this: why must our reaction be immediately defensive? It goes without saying that not all men rape, so why the need to individually reassert this, thus making it about ourselves? The egocentric route is to preserve our reputation before Hannah's or any other victim's, as if to invalidate their voices. They've been dismissed forever, but no longer. Hannah admits that the way forward is not easy. Although she bludgeons us with hate and rage, it's ultimately not in her best interests. To smooth over her trauma with punchlines and one-liners is to continue her self-humiliation, the shame of being herself. So she must quit comedy to tell her full story. Here's one more clue; as she's breaking down each part of the anecdote, she reveals that she needs to tell her story properly, and then cracks a smile out of reflex, almost as if she is retreating back into a comedic comfort zone. This is no performance. And she's done with papering over cracks.",0,,ur33734362,10 July 2018,0,,265,223,6.618867924528302,0.8415094339622642,"('hannah', 5)('audience', 3)('enough', 3)('shes', 3)('lesbian', 3)('comedy', 3)('tension', 3)('early', 2)('consider', 2)('special', 2)","['good', 'hannah', 'gadsby', 'nanette', 'youll', 'notice', 'quite', 'early', 'onstage', 'persona', 'consists', 'characterised', 'tittering', 'uneven', 'cadence', 'variations', 'pitch', 'pauses', 'consider', 'audience', 'also', 'proceed', 'every', 'shell', 'let', 'unable', 'keep', 'nervous', 'chuckle', 'say', 'lighten', 'cant', 'take', 'joke', 'first', 'half', 'netflix', 'special', 'unsure', 'played', 'version', 'hannah', 'detractors', 'pointed', 'unfunny', 'uncomedic', 'special', 'isnt', 'trying', 'narrow', 'parametres', 'artistic', 'category', 'welcoming', 'innovation', 'boundary', 'pushing', 'hannahs', 'categorised', 'enough', 'life', 'gay', 'comedian', 'faces', 'perplexing', 'dilemma', 'shes', 'condemned', 'lesbian', 'condemned', 'lesbian', 'enough', 'life', 'wasnt', 'hard', 'enough', 'already', 'hour', 'commands', 'stage', 'audiences', 'attention', 'later', 'walk', 'streets', 'mistaken', 'man', 'little', 'power', 'reports', 'quitting', 'comedy', 'may', 'somewhat', 'exaggerated', 'although', 'hannah', 'doesnt', 'revolutionise', 'artform', 'like', 'gushed', 'makes', 'pointed', 'observation', 'tension', 'comedic', 'performance', 'authenticity', 'hooks', 'audience', 'early', 'lesbian', 'content', 'punchlines', 'related', 'tricky', 'process', 'coming', 'arent', 'uncommon', 'oneliners', 'parents', 'tend', 'reposition', 'childrens', 'trauma', 'theres', 'tension', 'tension', 'deflated', 'laugh', 'may', 'comforting', 'isnt', 'truth', 'hannah', 'walks', 'us', 'formative', 'years', 'jokes', 'circles', 'back', 'reveal', 'truth', 'shame', 'behind', 'laughs', 'halfcompleted', 'degree', 'art', 'history', 'begins', 'feeble', 'punchline', 'accomplishments', 'outside', 'comedy', 'later', 'weaved', 'bitter', 'ammunition', 'diatribe', 'historical', 'protection', 'powerful', 'mens', 'reputations', 'expense', 'women', 'around', 'point', 'men', 'audience', 'start', 'shift', 'uncomfortably', 'seats', 'turn', 'attention', 'fascinating', 'patterns', 'walls', 'admittedly', 'extent', 'consider', 'must', 'reaction', 'immediately', 'defensive', 'goes', 'without', 'saying', 'men', 'rape', 'need', 'individually', 'reassert', 'thus', 'making', 'egocentric', 'route', 'preserve', 'reputation', 'hannahs', 'victims', 'invalidate', 'voices', 'theyve', 'dismissed', 'forever', 'longer', 'hannah', 'admits', 'way', 'forward', 'easy', 'although', 'bludgeons', 'us', 'hate', 'rage', 'ultimately', 'best', 'interests', 'smooth', 'trauma', 'punchlines', 'oneliners', 'continue', 'selfhumiliation', 'shame', 'must', 'quit', 'comedy', 'tell', 'full', 'story', 'heres', 'one', 'clue', 'shes', 'breaking', 'part', 'anecdote', 'reveals', 'needs', 'tell', 'story', 'properly', 'cracks', 'smile', 'reflex', 'almost', 'retreating', 'back', 'comedic', 'comfort', 'zone', 'performance', 'shes', 'done', 'papering', 'cracks']"

931,8465676,"I'm going to try and be fair. I disagree with her left wing sjw political opinions. We see the world differently, and that is okay. I do have to call out her sexism towards men though. There are times where she makes some negative generalisations about men. I can understand why given her life experiences, but it is by definition sexism, and I feel obligated to point it out. For the most part she at least tried to work jokes into what she was saying. Towards the end there were some parts where she completely abandoned telling any jokes, and instead gave deeply emotional speeches about her own personal tragedies. I had mixed feelings about this. I was able to relate to a lot of what she was saying. I think anyone who is damaged and has been an outsider will relate. It took courage to open up like she did. That being said, as soon as you abandon telling jokes like that, it stops being stand up comedy. Richard Pryor was able to open up about his personal tragedies, but he could also make the stories hilarious. Towards the end she just gave up completely on making jokes. I think she is brave for opening up, and she is clearly capable of writing jokes, but I can't give this higher than a 7 because at times it is more like a one woman show than stand up comedy. I don't mind if she wants to make a serious show about her life, but then it shouldn't be in the comedy section. That is probably why she says she wants to quit comedy.

932,8465676,"I watched this after discovering ""Douglas"" on Netflix and really enjoyed the humor and also being educated about some things (Art history - Wow! lots of things I was never taught!) and lead to some really thought-provoking realizations. Hannah has such a talent for using humor to teach people, I loved this! I am a straight female who thinks every woman should watch. Also, men should watch but they would have to have a VERY open mind! lol Nanette is a tougher show to watch then Douglas - but still very insightful and thought-provoking. Hannah has overcome many struggles in her life from physical pain to internal pain as we all have in our lives. I relate to her as far as a woman made to feel guilt and shame over things and viewed as differently than a man. I am a woman who was sexually harassed many times in the work place in the 80's - 90's but felt I had no power to do anything about it. I just felt it was part of what a woman had to deal with otherwise you were really mistreated and called a B! So glad there are now laws in place to prevent these things but it takes guts to report it because there is a shame where women are made to feel like we caused it for looking pretty or many other lame reasons. I am someone who has a wonderful loving husband and grew up with a loving father but seeing the violence that men have produced has created a fear that allows me and probably many women to relate to Hannah's fear. It is sad that women have to be fearful walking down a street alone due to men but I'm not sure what could ever change this with so many women involved in porn / prostitution feeding into being only objects of sex for men (of course, this is a whole other subject and an industry set up by men) , but Hannah Gadsby is a start!

I have no space in my life for comedians who hate anyone, whether they be men, women, white or black etc. But here's the thing.You've got ""comedy"" and you've got drama. If you're mixing the two together in The cocktail That is your Netflix special, you have to think about measurements. If liquor is drama and the mixer is the comedy (makes sense I think?) Gadsby creates a disgusting cocktail of all vodka and a thimbles worth of orange juice. That's not a screwdriver, that's a gateway to a hangover a mess of vomit in your Uber! I don't want to drink that! Rather, I want a fancy cocktail with liquor and a mixer and bitters and sugar and lime! I want to laugh! I want to cry! I want to feel! I don't want to cringe that much.I cringed so hard at most of her jokes. I barely laughed. She goes from trying to be funny from admitting she was raped. It's a mess. She's screaming and saying she doesn't want to be seen as a victim while screaming to her audience that she's a victim. It's throughly unpleasant.Honestly, I'm thinking if this was a SERIOUS Ted Talk where Hannah talks about all of these issues and about what happened to her, maaaaaybe it could have worked out. But the tonal shifts are all over the place and it's messy and unfunny. None of it resonated with me.Chuck D was right.

945,8465676,"Until now, Hannah Gadsby had only been known in Australia, where she had been quite successful for many years. Hers was one of the early diverse voices on the Aussie comedy circuit. In this show she graduates to a global audience, with a refreshed, more profound, emotional and humanistic tone. Her observations are often fresh -in every sense of the word- and I get that some viewers who expected a ""good ol' laugh"" may have been surprised, shocked, or disappointed by her performance. In truth, she ruthlessly deconstructs some of the taken-for-granted conceptions that underpin much social norms in Western society: power, patriarchy, money, art, sex, or mental illness -Michel Foucauld did exactly the same, but he wasn't as funny as Hannah. No wonder some will dislike her act. Taking down unspoken norms that underpin Western social order, sounds like a terrible idea for a comedy show. In truth, not all of it is laugh-your-head-off funny. I guess it was intentional. Gadsby's show tries to go back-and-forth across that thin line separating drama and comedy, and by and large she pulls it off, with humour, emotion, and a truckload of humanity. In doing so, Gadsby is courageous, laying bare what must have been difficult moments for her, and I was moved by the way she re-tells her coming out story.

One is that I don't think Bo should be saying a gay slur on stage, although the salt and vinegar joke was hilarious, and I think is only made even better when you remember he was specifically talking to all the white people in the crowd.And the other is that the opening of this special seemed to be implying that there would be a consistent theme to this, much like Inside, but there wasn't really any such thing. It goes from straight white privilege, to nursery rhyme rap, to country music slander, to Pringles cans, and I might not have minded this if the opening part wasn't there, because I was kind of expecting something more consistently going for anti-humour, and for the most part it wasn't.But that aside, this is amazing stand up.

982,5192124,"Bo Burnham's second hour-long special, ""Make Happy"", is a true culmination of his comedic experience, and his swan song in the stand-up field. It is the epitome of a comedy show with meaning. Burnham weaves, even the seemingly meaningless and lighthearted, bits of this show, into an interconnected and meaningful tapestry of comedy and messaging. Burnham explores what it means to be an entertainer in the internet age, and always has full control of his audience, both live and streaming, as he subtly dips his toes into the deeper topics throughout the show, referencing the deeper meaning in much of his material. This comes to a head in his final act in the show, set up as a Kanye West-type rant about problems that are surface-level and meaningless. It starts with complaints about Pringle can diameters, then an overstuffed burrito at chipotle, the latter of which he later reveals to be a metaphor for his own life and experiences as an entertainer. The special wraps up with one question, which connects to the meaning of the entire show: ""Are you happy?"" Bo Burnham's excellent pacing and edge towards the deeper meaning of his show throughout are the perfect example of modern comedy with true, deeper meaning.

984,2112999,"I'm been really surprised by how much I enjoyed Louis CK's show Louie – it has a weird mix of the tragic and the hilarious but yet it all works together rather than pulling in different ways. So when he announced this special and that it would be available for $5 without any restrictions on what computer you can play it on etc, he was going to get my ongoing support. Ironically I watched this in the week when the internet was protesting the SOPA legislation and that the owners of Megaupload were extradited to the US to face a maximum of 55 years in prison each for their terrible crimes against humanity; and while the rights holders of bad, overpriced products continue to try to batter down anyone daring not to pay for the privilege of seeing another generic superhero movie, Louis CK provides a quality product at a good price and trust the audience.I was happy to pay the $5 to download this – so happy that I didn't even mind that Amazon glitched during payment and I tried Paypal before realising that payment had actually gone through. So for £3 I got this great hour - £3 compared to the usual £12 distributors charge for putting it on a plastic disk and posting to it me. I'm sure this still got pirated, but checking Louis' website shows a note about how much money he made from direct sales and that this will enable him to do more with it. It is good to see people do positive things to challenge piracy, rather than threatening the parents of a 13 year old girl with jail because she downloaded a Justin Bieber song on their internet connection. Anyway, moving on.As with his TV show, Louis covers a range of topics with honesty and imagination, so that he may be saying terrible, terrible things, but they are never without a root in reality (well, mostly). Talking about wanting to be a good person (but being too selfish or lazy to do so), talking about the hardest thing about being a parent is the boredom and of course many social and sexual situation which he delivers in this usual way – sort of frustrated with how he feels but at the same time unwilling to change for the better. His imaginative delivery and mixed of tiredness with reality works for me.The reason to watch this special is that it is hilarious. The fact that it is reasonably priced with no draconian controls on the customer and that the money goes to the artist and not the multinational corporation between the customer and the artist is all the more reason for getting it. Louis CK's comedy is clever, insightful and intelligent – no surprise that he has come up with a way to combat piracy that exposes the heavy-handed measure for what they are.",0,,ur1002035,21 January 2012,0,,228,196,6.206140350877193,0.8596491228070176,"('louis', 5)('terrible', 3)('good', 3)('im', 2)('much', 2)('cks', 2)('show', 2)('hilarious', 2)('works', 2)('rather', 2)","['im', 'really', 'surprised', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'louis', 'cks', 'show', 'louie', 'weird', 'mix', 'tragic', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'works', 'together', 'rather', 'pulling', 'different', 'ways', 'announced', 'special', 'would', 'available', 'without', 'restrictions', 'computer', 'play', 'etc', 'going', 'get', 'ongoing', 'support', 'ironically', 'watched', 'week', 'internet', 'protesting', 'sopa', 'legislation', 'owners', 'megaupload', 'extradited', 'us', 'face', 'maximum', 'years', 'prison', 'terrible', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'rights', 'holders', 'bad', 'overpriced', 'products', 'continue', 'try', 'batter', 'anyone', 'daring', 'pay', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'another', 'generic', 'superhero', 'movie', 'louis', 'ck', 'provides', 'quality', 'product', 'good', 'price', 'trust', 'audiencei', 'happy', 'pay', 'download', 'happy', 'didnt', 'even', 'mind', 'amazon', 'glitched', 'payment', 'tried', 'paypal', 'realising', 'payment', 'actually', 'gone', 'got', 'great', 'hour', 'compared', 'usual', 'distributors', 'charge', 'putting', 'plastic', 'disk', 'posting', 'im', 'sure', 'still', 'got', 'pirated', 'checking', 'louis', 'website', 'shows', 'note', 'much', 'money', 'made', 'direct', 'sales', 'enable', 'good', 'see', 'people', 'positive', 'things', 'challenge', 'piracy', 'rather', 'threatening', 'parents', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'jail', 'downloaded', 'justin', 'bieber', 'song', 'internet', 'connection', 'anyway', 'moving', 'onas', 'tv', 'show', 'louis', 'covers', 'range', 'topics', 'honesty', 'imagination', 'may', 'saying', 'terrible', 'terrible', 'things', 'never', 'without', 'root', 'reality', 'well', 'mostly', 'talking', 'wanting', 'good', 'person', 'selfish', 'lazy', 'talking', 'hardest', 'thing', 'parent', 'boredom', 'course', 'many', 'social', 'sexual', 'situation', 'delivers', 'usual', 'way', 'sort', 'frustrated', 'feels', 'time', 'unwilling', 'change', 'better', 'imaginative', 'delivery', 'mixed', 'tiredness', 'reality', 'works', 'methe', 'reason', 'watch', 'special', 'hilarious', 'fact', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'draconian', 'controls', 'customer', 'money', 'goes', 'artist', 'multinational', 'corporation', 'customer', 'artist', 'reason', 'getting', 'louis', 'cks', 'comedy', 'clever', 'insightful', 'intelligent', 'surprise', 'come', 'way', 'combat', 'piracy', 'exposes', 'heavyhanded', 'measure']"

Too much cursing? Really? In a stand up? Banish the thought. How does Bill Maher get away with it every week?

Understand the man, understand the context. This isn't rocket science or brain surgery. And maybe it's lost on some other parts of the country but his irreverence with Kaiser Permanente, the largest healthcare system in California, was spot on.

1015,2609912,"Kevin Hart is one comedian many people can say they watched rise to stardom. I caught the train midway when I saw him do his thing on Comedy Central Presents a several years ago and have been following him ever since. For a man so new to the game, at the time, he had a great sense of going off the audience's vibe, and even to this day does he remain at self-aware of the public, not letting the fame go to his head in an identifiable way.His first theatrical comedian special titled Kevin Hart: Laugh at My Pain, which was released in 2011, was a passable film that would serve introductory purposes quite well, but seemed to be missing the genuine spark that his specials I'm a Grown Little Man and Seriously Funny possessed. Not to mention, the skits the film featured bordered on mildly amusing to downright tedious and unfunny. It was approximately fifty-minutes of stand-up comedy and thirty of redundant skits.Needless to say, there was notable hesitation between me and Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain, which arrives in theaters with a seemingly bigger, brasher marketing scheme than the one that Laugh at My Pain had. Especially seeing as the film opens with a setup, directed by Tim Story, similar to the one in the previous films that was downright cliché and easily-dismissible. It features Hart at a large party he is hosting, stating he'll pay for all the alcohol and he'll show all his guests a good time. Just when all is going good, people come up and say that he has said things he hasn't said, done things without clear justification, and, according to a fan, is a ""LAB"" (""local-ass bitch"" in terms of where he performs). While Hart tries to get a word in and explain his side of the story, no one lets him. He eventually demands his agent to book him a last-minute performance at Madison Square Garden in New York so he can explain his story.What follows is Hart shedding light and revealing some scandalous things about him that made headlines recently and shows that he is definitely not a ""LAB,"" seeing as he has performed abroad in places like Denmark, Oslo, and Copenhagen. Then, finally, we get the concert, which is often very funny and very down-to-earth. Hart, first, introduces what he calls ""pointless fire,"" which is random, ten foot tall lines of fire that shoot up on Hart's cue to add some flavor and spice to his show (he says he got the idea from a Jay-Z concert).Hart's topics involve being so happy you feed the pigeons in the park (which features Hart doing one of the most hilarious women-impressions I've heard in a while), women and their love of proving men wrong, except for one percent of the time, publicity issues he takes care of early on, and more. Let Me Explain isn't deep by any means; it sort of treads water on being a vanity project for Hart himself seeing as he almost never directs the content and humor away from himself. However, he isn't totally narcissistic and bravely admits and shows that he is still in touch with his roots despite his near-""global brand"" name, he explains in the film.Not to mention, much of Hart's humor derives from his quick-witted wordplay, his hilarious, conservative use of catchphrases (first it was ""Alright, alright, alright!"" now it's ""No! No! No! No! No!"" accompanied by a high, squeaky voice and an explanation), and his jivey-presence on a big stage. Even with a place as large and as massive as the Garden, Hart's small-self doesn't have much trouble catering to its enormous status.On a concluding note, it's also surprising to note how emotional and strong the finale was in terms of personal-resonance. Hart tells us it's rare for comedians to perform at the Garden and the fact that he has had this opportunity almost makes him go into a tear-session. It's a strong, beautiful little scene that concludes the film on a remarkably close to home note that indicates what can happen if dreams succeed, as cliché as that sounds. The best thing is he doesn't go into a ""rags to riches"" like memoir and keeps it simple. No need to explain on that.NOTE: My video review of Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWGBs1Z42pQStarring: Kevin Hart.

1016,2609912,"'KEVIN HART: LET ME EXPLAIN': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A stand-up comedy concert film featuring comedian Kevin Hart doing material from his 2012 'Let Me Explain' comedy tour. It was filmed in front of a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden and directed by Leslie Small and Tim Story. The movie also features clips from other shows on Hart's tour as well. If you're a fan of Kevin Hart's stand-up comedy you'll probably enjoy the movie but if you're not in to his comedy style (like me) than you probably won't get a kick out of it (it's as simple as that).The movie opens with Kevin Hart talking to his friends at a party trying to explain his relationship troubles and current success. As he becomes frustrated with trying to explain himself he gets the idea of doing a show at Madison Square Garden where he can explain himself to everyone. He then rushes to a show there right away. The film shows clips of other concerts on his tour before playing the Madison Square Garden show in it's entirety.I like Kevin Hart in movies, I think he's a very funny and likable actor, but seeing his stand-up comedy for the first time (in this movie) I was not impressed. I think he talks too fast and acts too much like a spaz to be relatable at all. His jokes are OK but nothing 'laugh out loud' hilarious. To be fair I'm not a big fan of most stand-up comedy in general; there are very few comedians who can really make me laugh. So I wouldn't say Hart is much worse than anyone else. I wasn't impressed with this film though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4",0,,ur15977902,2 December 2013,0,,158,106,5.518987341772152,0.6708860759493671,"('comedy', 6)('movie', 6)('kevin', 5)('hart', 5)('explain', 5)('standup', 4)('show', 4)('film', 3)('tour', 3)('madison', 3)","['kevin', 'hart', 'let', 'explain', 'two', 'half', 'stars', 'five', 'standup', 'comedy', 'concert', 'film', 'featuring', 'comedian', 'kevin', 'hart', 'material', 'let', 'explain', 'comedy', 'tour', 'filmed', 'front', 'soldout', 'crowd', 'madison', 'square', 'garden', 'directed', 'leslie', 'small', 'tim', 'story', 'movie', 'also', 'features', 'clips', 'shows', 'harts', 'tour', 'well', 'youre', 'fan', 'kevin', 'harts', 'standup', 'comedy', 'youll', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'youre', 'comedy', 'style', 'like', 'probably', 'wont', 'get', 'kick', 'simple', 'thatthe', 'movie', 'opens', 'kevin', 'hart', 'talking', 'friends', 'party', 'trying', 'explain', 'relationship', 'troubles', 'current', 'success', 'becomes', 'frustrated', 'trying', 'explain', 'gets', 'idea', 'show', 'madison', 'square', 'garden', 'explain', 'everyone', 'rushes', 'show', 'right', 'away', 'film', 'shows', 'clips', 'concerts', 'tour', 'playing', 'madison', 'square', 'garden', 'show', 'entiretyi', 'like', 'kevin', 'hart', 'movies', 'think', 'hes', 'funny', 'likable', 'actor', 'seeing', 'standup', 'comedy', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'impressed', 'think', 'talks', 'fast', 'acts', 'much', 'like', 'spaz', 'relatable', 'jokes', 'ok', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'loud', 'hilarious', 'fair', 'im', 'big', 'fan', 'standup', 'comedy', 'general', 'comedians', 'really', 'make', 'laugh', 'wouldnt', 'say', 'hart', 'much', 'worse', 'anyone', 'else', 'wasnt', 'impressed', 'film', 'thoughwatch', 'movie', 'review', 'show', 'movie', 'talk']"

It starts with Kevin at a party with friends and fans. Some of the fans start getting on his nerves by saying things that they say Kevin said-he denies it-and accusing him of doing things that he says he didn't. One fan even accuses Kevin of being a LAB, which stands for 'Local-Ass-Bitch' and it refers to where he performs his stand up-they are saying he has never been out of the country. Kevin gets so angry that he tells his agent, who luckily is also at the party, that he needs to book Madison Square Garden right now, so he can explain his side of things. Clips are shown of Kevin performing in other countries such as Sweden, The Netherlands, Canada and England, all to sold out crowds. The rest of the movie, he is shown at Madison Square Garden, New York, performing to a sold out crowd-It is mentioned that he is in rare company of being only the second comedian to perform there-they did not mention the first.

1020,2609912,". . . at 5-feet, 2-inches tall, Kevin Hart certainly has the form to go with a style more than reminiscent of Rooney. While it is true that early Hart vehicles such as SCARY MOVIE may not be in the same league with Rooney's boyhood work--including NATIONIAL VELVET and the Andy Hardy series--movies in general are pretty much apples and oranges when compared to Hollywood's output of the 1940s under the Golden Age of the Studio System. Ironically enough, LET ME EXPLAIN shows what an ordeal it is when the performers such as Hart must manage their own retinue and parties, rather than having studio flacks to do the heavy lifting for them. Many instances of backstage and behind-the-scenes chaos are captured by LET ME EXPLAIN directors Leslie Small and Tim Story, due to Hart's lack of the level of support Rooney enjoyed in his heyday under the studio system.

However, one thing I can't stand is the Kevin Hart we see off stage when he plays up his sudden celebrity and starts acting pompous like he does on Real Husbands of Hollywood.With that said, unfortunately you get to see that Kevin for at least 10 or more minutes in the beginning of the movie and though others may find him being like an entitled child funny, I found myself waiting to laugh. Luckily though, after a bit of vanity by him proving himself as a successful comedian by showing how he had sold out shows throughout Europe, and after getting his usual comeuppance after his ego got too big, we finally start the damn comedy program. Now, in the show he goes over a variety of topics, both for jokes and to explain some things about his life. He talks about his divorce, including the cheating and lying he did; Him being a liar in general, a bad one at that; Trust issues in a relationship; The single life; having kids, much less knowing they may one day have a step dad; his interactions with his son; and lastly a joke dealing with bums.For me, once the actual stand up comedy came into play, I found it hard to stop laughing. Within about a hour or 45 minutes, of which is the actual stand up, I laughed a counted 41 times. Thing is, depending on what type of comedy you like, there maybe more opportunities to laugh, but some of what he said I either couldn't get or simply wasn't my type of comedy. Also, I was thankful that his best bits weren't what we saw on the trailer. Often times in movie the best stuff is used for the trailer and then you are just waiting for those moments while everything else is just bleh. Luckily though, many of his jokes will make you laugh out loud and even trying to hold back the sound of your laugh is futile. For a few moments in particular, I found myself in a slight bit of pain from laughing a little too hard.With that said however, I am not a fan of his prologue to the stand up. Entering in the theater, you already know who Kevin Hart is and him trying to prove how famous he is seemed like a waste of time. Add onto that, him being the egotistical Kevin Hart who has constant meltdowns, and I felt that the whole skit/ segment should have been cut for it really did nothing for the film. It really made me wish comedians nowadays would follow the Eddie Murphy example, i.e. Raw, and just show them go to the venue and do the damn performance. Outside of that though, I had just about no issues.Overall: Go See It Though the first 10-15 minutes seem like a real waste of time, there are jokes in there which people around me did laugh at. But, once the stand up starts you will be laughing and getting mad that someone is laughing loud as hell, and clapping, in your ear. Still, considering the movie is only a little bit past an hour and packs a lot of laughs, consider this movie a good pick me up if the year so far has been stressful.",0,,ur6177494,4 July 2013,0,,281,204,5.540925266903915,0.7259786476868327,"('like', 7)('stand', 6)('kevin', 5)('though', 5)('laugh', 5)('hart', 4)('movie', 4)('comedy', 4)('laughing', 4)('one', 3)","['like', 'people', 'like', 'kevin', 'hart', 'funny', 'replaces', 'awol', 'katt', 'williams', 'likable', 'stand', 'however', 'one', 'thing', 'cant', 'stand', 'kevin', 'hart', 'see', 'stage', 'plays', 'sudden', 'celebrity', 'starts', 'acting', 'pompous', 'like', 'real', 'husbands', 'hollywoodwith', 'said', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'see', 'kevin', 'least', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'movie', 'though', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'like', 'entitled', 'child', 'funny', 'found', 'waiting', 'laugh', 'luckily', 'though', 'bit', 'vanity', 'proving', 'successful', 'comedian', 'showing', 'sold', 'shows', 'throughout', 'europe', 'getting', 'usual', 'comeuppance', 'ego', 'got', 'big', 'finally', 'start', 'damn', 'comedy', 'program', 'show', 'goes', 'variety', 'topics', 'jokes', 'explain', 'things', 'life', 'talks', 'divorce', 'including', 'cheating', 'lying', 'liar', 'general', 'bad', 'one', 'trust', 'issues', 'relationship', 'single', 'life', 'kids', 'much', 'less', 'knowing', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'step', 'dad', 'interactions', 'son', 'lastly', 'joke', 'dealing', 'bumsfor', 'actual', 'stand', 'comedy', 'came', 'play', 'found', 'hard', 'stop', 'laughing', 'within', 'hour', 'minutes', 'actual', 'stand', 'laughed', 'counted', 'times', 'thing', 'depending', 'type', 'comedy', 'like', 'maybe', 'opportunities', 'laugh', 'said', 'either', 'couldnt', 'get', 'simply', 'wasnt', 'type', 'comedy', 'also', 'thankful', 'best', 'bits', 'werent', 'saw', 'trailer', 'often', 'times', 'movie', 'best', 'stuff', 'used', 'trailer', 'waiting', 'moments', 'everything', 'else', 'bleh', 'luckily', 'though', 'many', 'jokes', 'make', 'laugh', 'loud', 'even', 'trying', 'hold', 'back', 'sound', 'laugh', 'futile', 'moments', 'particular', 'found', 'slight', 'bit', 'pain', 'laughing', 'little', 'hardwith', 'said', 'however', 'fan', 'prologue', 'stand', 'entering', 'theater', 'already', 'know', 'kevin', 'hart', 'trying', 'prove', 'famous', 'seemed', 'like', 'waste', 'time', 'add', 'onto', 'egotistical', 'kevin', 'hart', 'constant', 'meltdowns', 'felt', 'whole', 'skit', 'segment', 'cut', 'really', 'nothing', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'wish', 'comedians', 'nowadays', 'would', 'follow', 'eddie', 'murphy', 'example', 'ie', 'raw', 'show', 'go', 'venue', 'damn', 'performance', 'outside', 'though', 'issuesoverall', 'go', 'see', 'though', 'first', 'minutes', 'seem', 'like', 'real', 'waste', 'time', 'jokes', 'people', 'around', 'laugh', 'stand', 'starts', 'laughing', 'getting', 'mad', 'someone', 'laughing', 'loud', 'hell', 'clapping', 'ear', 'still', 'considering', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'past', 'hour', 'packs', 'lot', 'laughs', 'consider', 'movie', 'good', 'pick', 'year', 'far', 'stressful']"
1022,2609912,"Kevin Hart's Let Me Explain is an interesting conundrum.On one hand you have another great hour of comedy from one of the better stand-up comics in the business today.But on the other hand we have a muddled production with choppy editing, sloppy directing, and poor sound mixing that prevents this comedic movie from aging with the greats like Raw, Live on the Sunset Strip, and Himself.What also hurts Let Me Explain is the short running time, the extremely egotistical preshow, and the failed skit in the beginning of the entire thing. If Hart can simply manage to stretch his material a little longer and delete all the extra fluff then he would be a little closer of reaching the comedic Rushmore of Pryor, 80s Murphy, Rock, and my main man George Carlin. He still has a ways to go though.If you are a Kevin Hart fan, then you will not be disappointed. He once again spits out quick funny anecdotes, throws in a couple great catchphrases, and is never afraid of making fun of himself. He once again dedicates plenty of time to talking about women and relationship clichés; and these moments provide the biggest laughs because he takes the moments we can all relate to and stretch them into exaggeratory measures to successful jokes. He also has this likability factor that allows for him to control the crowd and never lose them, not for a single second.And then we have all the technical issues. First off for a Madison Square Garden the audience was quite quiet. Was it the jokes not hitting? No, it's that the sound editing focused pretty much 95% on Hart, leaving the movie sounding quieter than it should. Part of a good comedic concert is listening to the audience react to the stories and collectively understand the verbal motions of one individual. Remember the epic battles Richard Pryor had against his audience on Sunset Strip? With this production staff we never would have truly enjoyed it.As a matter of fact, it was tough to enjoy anything in the first fifteen minutes. The opening skit was uneven, just like the last one in Laugh at my Pain. And then it was followed by a sequence that should have been kept for the closing credits. The movie needed 20 minutes to truly get going. Jerry Seinfeld once said that usually comedians have only one minute to catch the audience otherwise he/she fails. The only reason why Kevin Hart was allowed 20 is because his material over the years has been consistently funny, and we all secretly knew that no matter how lame the material with his buddies are, it would all be forgiven once he steps up on the mic...even if the first act drags miserably.But Kevin seriously, drop your friends.

The first 20 minutes were not even comedy, they were just a poorly written parody of him at a party trying to ""explain"" himself to his friends. Then the next 30 minutes were just boring, especially for Kevin Hart's standards. By that time, you're checking the clock every five minutes anxious for the special to end. Finally, after that snooze fest, some great, classic Hart-humor kicks in. I'd say the last 30 minutes of the special were outstanding and make the special worth watching.

1024,2609912,"Kevin Hart has taken his comedy to a new level with Let Me Explain. He doesn't just open with the back stage preparation (and customary prayer) prior to performing his newest stand-up routine, he gives the audience a mini feature film complete with the set up for all the issues currently plaguing him in the media, and the backlash that he gets from the public and the people around him. Mr. Hart's star is definitely on the rise, with a hit television show and a number of feature films forth-coming, he said it best on the BET Awards 'turnt up'! He showcases his success in the film by cleverly taking the audience on a ride along with him and his entourage as he tours Canada and the United Kingdom to sold out venues providing some insight into his popularity outside the US. It seems that he is a global hit not simply a well-known comedic powerhouse to just Black America. The jokes were smart and funny and were delivered in such a manner that I was rocking forward with laughter. The profanity was excessive and in some cases unnecessary for the stories being told to be humorous, but Kevin Hart's approach to comedy is much like many of his predecessors Dick Gregory, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock who have grown out of an environment in which the language was a part of the norm of everyday life, so it's only fitting that the profanity is infused throughout the routine. I get it, but more prudish ears may find it somewhat offensive, especially the use of the N-word, which punctuated every narrative. The fare in this film is definitely not for consumption by small children. After hearing the jokes about so many aspects of his personal life, his divorce and his children I left the theater feeling as if I knew Kevin Hart just a little bit better. His tale of the possibility of being touched by the homeless gave me a whole new perspective of how important the boundaries of personal space are. Having a significant enough following to be able to fill seats in a theater is an impressive feat for any entertainer especially a stand-up comedian. This was an entertaining film, it was funny and engaging. The running time was 75 minutes which seemed to fly as in 'time flies when you're having fun.

1025,2609912,"Before I get into this ""Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain"" review, I feel like I should get into the history of Kevin Hart for a second...Not counting his half-hour special on Comedy Central, ""I'm A Grown Little Man"" was Hart's first big stand-up special, back in 2009. And it was a CLASSIC. It's one of the few stand-up specials that you could go back and watch time and time again, and still laugh just as hard as the first time. It was never a theater release, so it's not BDBOS eligible, but if it was, it would have easily been a 5 out of 5.""Seriously Funny"" was his second stand-up special, in 2010. It's hard to top your first time out when you completely crush it like that, but he came damn close. Again, if it was eligible, it would have been a 4.5 out of 5.Then came his first theater release, ""Laugh At My Pain"", which hit theaters last year. The movie covered his 2011 tour of the same name, in which he broke a record held by Eddie Murphy for ticket sales over a two-day period by an African-American comedian. (he cracked 1.1 millions in sales for the two-day live set at the Nokia Theater in L.A.)Here's where it gets a little funky...""Laugh At My Pain"" wasn't as good as his first two specials. And, by movie standards, it was short – it clocked in at just over an hour. They tried to fill in some extra time by throwing in a produced short at the end of it, featuring Hart and his friends, but it didn't do much to improve the overall flick. Don't get me wrong, it was still funny, but it fell short of the standards that we came to expect. It scored a 3 out of 5.So now we get to ""Let Me Explain"", which covers his latest tour that hit Madison Square Garden. This is still shortan hour and a half, tops. But it's definitely better than ""Laugh At My Pain"", and had me cry-laughing at one pointit's pretty damn good. And there's a pretty touching moment at the end, where the idea of being one of the very few comics to headline at MSG both humbles him and gets him emotional. Pretty cool stuff.""Let Me Explain"" scores a 8 out of 10 on the BDBOS.

1027,2609912,"8/10Unlike my other favorite comedian, Louis C.K., Kevin Hart is somewhat of a formulaic comedian. While that is absolutely not a bad thing at all, it is to be noted that a bulk of his material comes from 3 main topics, all of which he expands on so amazingly well:1. He will dissect common relationship problems that most everyone can relate to2. He will state a certain trait of his character and tell a story as to why he became that way3. He will state a somewhat uncommon fear of his and tell a story about the origin of that fearAfter watching all of his previous stand ups, it did begin to get somewhat predictable because of it's overly unbelievable nature. This is not to say that I wasn't laughing like crazy throughout all of them. When I heard about this special being theatrically released I knew I was going to see on opening night. Not much is to be said about anything other than the fact that the whole theater was roaring with laughter for 90% of the time. Now back to the formula; Kevin did adhere to it here and there, but I think the reason everyone enjoyed this so much was because he threw in a mix of tiny little 2-3 minute segments that had really nothing to do with anything and it just worked. He veered off a bit from talking about himself or about relationships and he just started talking about people in general and the way we are with one another. In general, I think this was his best one yet. I think his formula is one of the more advanced and genuinely true ways to intrigue people. Even though it is a comedy special, and you don't quite know exactly how much of it is true or false, Kevin Hart has a great way of connecting through to the audience on a more personal level through the way he talks about himself and his relationships.

1030,2609912,"I rated this 9 out of 10 only because I know that every comedian can't make every person laugh because everyone has a different sense of humor and relates to different experiences. On my personal scale this movie was a 10. Kevin Hart booked two sold out shows at Madison Square Garden, which became the backdrop for the performance used in Let Me Explain. Kevin Hart is short and silly, but comes from a very relatable place if you're a parent, spouse, ex-spouse, man or woman. What he lacks in his height, he makes up for with her personality. His audience is diverse and the documentary portion of the film takes the time to show us that as well by highlighting some of his recent travels and sold out shows. Let Me Explain is Kevin Hart's response to some of the rumors that have been in blogs about him, his relationship with his father, his life and his divorce. You can't help but admire how transparently Hart discusses his experiences on stage. Like many great comedian's before him, Hart has discussions with his audience versus telling jokes. At one point, I found myself holding my hand over my mouth and tears were flowing from my eyes because I was laughing so hard. In fact, Hart made himself laugh during his performance. Hart has incredible comedic timing, but if you're laughing, which you will, you might miss something. So you may need to see it twice to catch what you missed the first time.

I recall seeing Richard Pryor discuss this after visiting Africa and pleaded with the up and coming black artists to just not use this word in their conversations or in their material. For a while, Richards words were heeded from what I seen, up until I watched this flick with Kevin. I was very disappointed in this and hope that Kevin would tone down his vulgarity just a tad.Then the use of ""GD"" was way overboard and I feel that the Fame that Kevin has obtained in recent years has gone to his head and he no longer cares about the audience he has attracted to his events and productions.

1033,2609912,"Kevin Hart is poised to become the next big comedy star walking the trail once blazed by Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock. He first made noticeable appearances on TV series, many of the spoof movies like Scary Movie 3 & 4, Epic Movie, Extreme Movie and other small movie roles, especially his most famous in a small hilarious piece in The 40 year Old Virgin where he plays a dissatisfied customer. He starred in his first movie as a lead, Soul Plane in (2004). Most recently he had a small cameo in Seth Rogen's This is the End. The fact that he was included in that movie which also featured other small uncredited cameos by a host of A-list actors, shows Hart is considered among the elite comic actors in Hollywood.Unlike a lot of other comedians, Hart's style uses more imagination than observation. He sees things differently than other comedians and employs a very self-deprecating humor that other urban comedians would be too self-conscious to use. Especially other black comedians. He doesn't have to spend five minutes on race or excessive sex jokes to make his point. Though he does sometimes use the N-word, he doesn't use it as a crutch. One of his usual devices is his size. Hart is reportedly only 5'2"". He also derives a lot of his humor from his experiences as a father with two young kids. All of these things makes him a comedian with broader appeal than the rest of his peers.""Let Me Explain"" is his fourth stand-up movie and fifth solo stand-up appearance if you include his ""Comedy Central Presents"" (2004) stand-up routine. After a filmed opening routine, Hart comes to the stage in Madison Square Garden for his first time. This shows he really has made a large impact in his field as the packed-house audience is filled with a large cross-section of people including celebrities in the front rows. Here he proceeds to talk about everything from his kids, bodyguards, homeless people, divorce, horse rides, etc.Though not as funny as some of his earlier stand-ups, I still found it hilarious. Hart has the ability to bring you into his world, where other comedians simply make observations on everyday things.

1072,3397430,"Having heard audio of Russell Brand on the Democracy Now radio show and before the British Parliament, as well as hearing him going off on US cable news shows, I have developed both a grudging respect and appreciation of him. He is capable of being both extremely clever and extremely funny, sometimes at the same time. But there are also huge gaps in his education and maturity, and during the course of this performance film, these gaps are on display a number of times. The opening conceit of this show, the concept of the hero, is a worthy topic and Brand shows guts and wit by sharing an unflattering anecdote regarding Mahatma Ghandi, for instance (his point is not to destroy the reputation of Ghandi...his point is that all so-called 'heroes' are human beings with human foibles...). At the beginning of the show, you really think he's going to go deep and really interesting. Which he frequently does, but never quite as far as I think he is actually capable of. And there is plenty of laugh out loud stuff, for sure. But he also has this embarrassing juvenile tendency to be crude and/or offensive just to show he can be crude and offensive. Many comedians also do this, but whereas history shows that George Carlin was right, I doubt history will make Russell's crudeness seem insightful. To make it clear, I am talking about crudeness that simply isn't even funny...not because it is crude, just stuff that is unfunny.Fortunately, almost every time Brand crosses the line into crudeness for the sake of crudeness alone, he eventually crosses back into the funny/interesting stuff before you decide to turn off the video. The only time he doesn't cross back again is in the final bit. In the end, he decides to pantomime a giant, talking clitoris, which could theoretically be funny, but in this case, it is Jerry-Lewis-Level- Unfunny. So pay attention to the running time and to the counter as you play this video, and really, you can turn it off during this portion and not miss anything good. It's too bad the video ends on such a sophomoric note, because there are so many brilliant bits. But I guess that's what happens with a performer who is still hopefully in the upward stage of his development.",0,,ur7991675,13 July 2015,0,,193,154,6.248704663212435,0.7979274611398963,"('show', 4)('time', 4)('crudeness', 4)('brand', 3)('shows', 3)('also', 3)('really', 3)('stuff', 3)('crude', 3)('video', 3)","['heard', 'audio', 'russell', 'brand', 'democracy', 'radio', 'show', 'british', 'parliament', 'well', 'hearing', 'going', 'us', 'cable', 'news', 'shows', 'developed', 'grudging', 'respect', 'appreciation', 'capable', 'extremely', 'clever', 'extremely', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'time', 'also', 'huge', 'gaps', 'education', 'maturity', 'course', 'performance', 'film', 'gaps', 'display', 'number', 'times', 'opening', 'conceit', 'show', 'concept', 'hero', 'worthy', 'topic', 'brand', 'shows', 'guts', 'wit', 'sharing', 'unflattering', 'anecdote', 'regarding', 'mahatma', 'ghandi', 'instance', 'point', 'destroy', 'reputation', 'ghandihis', 'point', 'socalled', 'heroes', 'human', 'beings', 'human', 'foibles', 'beginning', 'show', 'really', 'think', 'hes', 'going', 'go', 'deep', 'really', 'interesting', 'frequently', 'never', 'quite', 'far', 'think', 'actually', 'capable', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'loud', 'stuff', 'sure', 'also', 'embarrassing', 'juvenile', 'tendency', 'crude', 'andor', 'offensive', 'show', 'crude', 'offensive', 'many', 'comedians', 'also', 'whereas', 'history', 'shows', 'george', 'carlin', 'right', 'doubt', 'history', 'make', 'russells', 'crudeness', 'seem', 'insightful', 'make', 'clear', 'talking', 'crudeness', 'simply', 'isnt', 'even', 'funnynot', 'crude', 'stuff', 'unfunnyfortunately', 'almost', 'every', 'time', 'brand', 'crosses', 'line', 'crudeness', 'sake', 'crudeness', 'alone', 'eventually', 'crosses', 'back', 'funnyinteresting', 'stuff', 'decide', 'turn', 'video', 'time', 'doesnt', 'cross', 'back', 'final', 'bit', 'end', 'decides', 'pantomime', 'giant', 'talking', 'clitoris', 'could', 'theoretically', 'funny', 'case', 'jerrylewislevel', 'unfunny', 'pay', 'attention', 'running', 'time', 'counter', 'play', 'video', 'really', 'turn', 'portion', 'miss', 'anything', 'good', 'bad', 'video', 'ends', 'sophomoric', 'note', 'many', 'brilliant', 'bits', 'guess', 'thats', 'happens', 'performer', 'still', 'hopefully', 'upward', 'stage', 'development']"
1073,3397430,"I was a fan of Brand's from the beginning- brilliant at the hyperactive speed of light, like Robin Williams but even more so. In early guest appearances over here his impromptu command of the language and quick wit were astonishing (shades of Dudley Moore). He was also humble and I found that endearing. OK, so it was an act, I STILL liked him. But I HATE the gratuitous designed-to-shock sexual elements of his stand-up routine.The comedy, taking the mickey out of himself, lamely (hilariously) likening himself to Gandhi, Malcolm X, Che Guevara and Christ, was inspired in many ways- as were his incisive observations on martyrdom, advertising, capitalism, and politics. But WHY must they be punctuated with irrelevant and purely gratuitous sexual references- every conceivable act, in graphic detail, from rimming to shagging his CAT? I'm no prude, I just found them unnecessary, distracting and CREEPY. Likening Malcolm X's masterful ability to quell a riot and disperse a crowd by simply raising his hand to Russell jerking off in public?He's written extensively about his sexual addiction/obsession (I read his autobiography, awful, in the same vein). Though aware of his problem, he cannot control, inhibit or censor himself. It's NOT of the same ilk as Richard Pryor making fun of himself after setting himself on fire smoking crack- he was in recovery and the comedy was after the fact- self-disclosing, hilarious, and even moving, inspiring. Brand is still in the throes of his delusions/obsessions- he's BRAGGING, trying to shock like some 13-year-old, pathetic. The LAST thing I want to see are his gyrations and gangly pelvic thrusts. Moreover, his comedy IMO would be much-improved if he could CONTAIN himself. Time to grow up.A closely related gripe is the sexism of many of his comments, using the ""C"" word liberally and other words derisive of women descriptively and to ridicule others. He's smart enough not to do it, and it smacks of hostility towards women. Were this not the case he would give equal time to gender neutral (e.g., words for the anus or excrement) or ""masculine"" derisive terms (bollocks, for example, and obscene euphemisms for the PENIS)- but he doesn't. You needn't be Freud for that to stand out like a sore thumb- indeed, to cotton on to the subtext (anger, self-belittling) that underpins nearly every bit, he continually debases himself. His routine is one big cry for help.I found Brand's choice of facts to include about Gandhi's relations with his wife peculiar. He mentioned that Gandhi married her at 13. What he didn't say was that for years she pleaded with him for sex, was devastated by his decision to become celibate, after they'd enjoyed a satisfying sex life and had two children. After making that decision Gandhi regularly had young nude girls brought to his bed, slept with them naked to test his resolve and self- control. Lots of comic possibilities there, but maybe partly because no sex took place, and Brand couldn't gyrate accordingly, of all the stories involving Mrs. Gandhi he instead chose the one that involved Gandhi KILLING her (denying her medication that would've saved her life). UGH. THEN, he likens that act to it being preferable for his wife instead of him to go downstairs and confront an intruder, and get murdered in the process. Tee- hee. ""I can get ANOTHER f***ing wife!"" A long way to go for THAT. And WHY??Then at the end, he has the nerve to say (with patent insincerity) how wonderful women are, and finally says: ""I HAVE to say that or I won't get laid after the show!"" Perhaps those who live vicariously through Russell Brand and envy his many assignations with random women find his braggadocio heartening but for me it's just sad, and mars both his comic genius and his humanity. I think others are so bedazzled by his machine-gun wit, verbal virtuosity, and potent charm that they overlook the rest.

Yes his delivery is funny, especially when talking about himself and his addictions, he takes self-deprecating to a new level, but what really blew me away were his seemingly incoherent ramblings that were in fact very insightful and made a lot of sense (to me).I am no prude, but some of the things he said and did gave me an ""ewe"" moment or two, but those moments were few and well worth sitting through to get to the other stuff.

1076,0200529,"Rock repels me when he tries to be in a ""real"" film. But I have to admit that he is a terrific standup guy.I assume that's true of him as a person, but what I mean is as a comic. I dive into these things from time to time and am frequently disappointed. Oh, sometimes I laugh but its only a half a laugh until you realize what's happening.Most standup is insult comedy, usually associated with identity comedy. I'm sure there is an immigrant, Vaudeville history there. But most black comics today do the identity thing.Rock is sort of a genius in what he does, and since it is so finely tuned it must be conscious.Here's what he does: he'll take the black community to task for some characteristic or behavior that is taboo to mention in the US. He'll hammer on it until it threatens to catch fire. Then in apparent seamlessness, he'll switch from being outside the group to inside and the switch itself will be funny.For instance, he'll riff on OJ and violent blacks and how OJ's wife deserved to be killed. People will howl with nervous laughter. Then without missing a beat or change tone, he'll make fun of such an attitude. Poking fun at stupid blacks who think this way. The laughter will not start anew but continue from the old, building layer upon layer. Then he'll switch back, talking about slapping a bitch around, Then another switch about how that's not acceptable. People still laughing. Oh, he'd never, never (many nevers) hit a woman....But he'd shake the bleep out her, and he caps it off by acting out this violence. Weeping, hurting laughter.Its because the man knows the precise point at which the boundary can be pushed. When he gets just to that point, just barely there, he pirouettes to the other side and pushes back until the boundary is dangerously close to breaking the other way.It's brilliant, because no one at all talks about that boundary in the US. Not seriously. So we get a couple things. We get to see a dancing concept master do his stuff. We get to confront something we avoid at all costs. We get to see risk in him and it makes us free to take some risks. Oh, we laugh. But we love the guy too.I've seen a few other shows.

Although the HBO special shares many routines in common with the album, there is also material not on the recording waiting to be discovered.Rock's routine is hilarious, with even the most topical bits still funny after fifteen years. Sketches about Marion Barry and the Million Man March continue to draw laughs, long after their expiration dates. Other, politically incorrect lines about race relations in the United States hold up long after the race debates of the nineties. This is in large part due to Chris Rock's energy and skilled delivery of the material.The last twenty minutes or so of the special drag out somewhat.

By today's standards, even the tossed salad euphemism is tame. But the key is Rock does have talent at building comic architecture; there's a foundation for all the jokes, the first level follows the shape of the foundation, and so on up. And visually, he knows how lead the crowd by stalking from side to side when changing stances.Pryor only had one note when acting for a movie, Cosby never really made great film headway, but Murphy blazed the film trail for any comics who dared to follow.

1080,0200529,"The much-anticipated feature-length debut special from Saturday Night Live alum Chris Rock. Rock would only spend 3 years at SNL before heading off on his own, eventually reinventing himself as a prominent name in stand-up. He had released an album, Born Suspect, while still a cast member of SNL, and enjoyed some success with his HBO debut, the half-hour special Big Ass Jokes, but his success was limited. However, there was a buzz coming into this night, with a captive crowd just waiting for Rock to deliver big. It's an expectation seemingly shared by Rock, himself. Right off the bat, album covers from stand-up greats (Bill Cosby, Dick Gregory, Flip Wilson (as Geraldine), Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Pigmeat Markham, Woody Allen and Eddie Murphy) are overlayed on footage of Rock making his way to the stage. Easing in with some material directed to his audience in Washington, Rock takes some jabs at Marion Barry (Note for the kids out there: He's kind of like the black Rob Ford) participating in the Million Man March festivities, which then leads him into a nice little run on crack that easily reels in the audience. From there, he explores politics, prisons, and the OJ Simpson trial before going into his views on the divide in the black community, highlighting the polarizing ways some in the community carry themselves, and unafraid to turn that spotlight inward with some keen criticisms. Once he's done covering these themes, Rock settles in and spends the last 15-20 minutes of his time exploring relationships between men and women, his charisma actually winning women over while he's pointing out their flaws. This isn't surprising as there aren't many who aren't won over by his million-dollar smile. This set turned Rock into a superstar, and it's easy to see why.

He thinks a lot about things nobody thinks about and that's what we like about him. His jokes are well thought of, most of the time obvious but only he thought about them.

And I am seriously asking, because this may not be something you want to watch if that is the case.Now the special drew big controversy because of one topic/subject matter. And Dave I would say was fully aware of it. Because it's not like he is not using language and making jokes right from the start. Some may feel attacked by those - like when he mixes serious things that happened and still happen - violence against Asians has risen for example due to the Corona Virus ""origin"" ... he makes a joke about his body and his immune system, that some may consider borderline racist and fueling anti-vaxxers and their desperate ""fight"".But that is what I (and of course many others as is evident by the rating here) consider the genius of Dave Chappelle! He really does not shy away from taking punches - but he also gets emotional. He is a human and he is openly admitting on being flawed. When he calls himself a ...phobic or tells us what he did at a certain time ... realizing himself it was not the best choice to make ... that's human. And all the while he is able to make us laugh - but also care. Not just for him, but others. He makes it his fight to show certain things in society - he doesn't claim to have the solution for any of it - but it sure is important to point things out.Going against ""wokeness"" is not a bad thing in my book. But it is a ""dangerous"" thing with people being cancelled left and right. Well certain people deserve it, but with the outrage machine impossible to stop, there will be victims too. Just the fact that I point this out will upset people. The fact of the matter is, that whatever you say, someone will be offended. You're either too nice or too aggressive or something else. You should always be true to yourself, while also acknowleding and respecting others and their feelings of course. But that is a journey and we all should be allowed to make mistakes.So while this is a dope comedy special (I hope the word dope is still being used), it is also a mirror to society in many respects.

I would not have watched this Netflix special if the current controversy surrounding it were more muted. Having seen it, I'm not sure whether I'd go back to watch any of his other stand-up routines. But here's the thing. The guy had something to say, and he came out and said it. You can call it misogynistic or gay bashing or transphobic, but in the current climate of woke culture, what he's saying needed to be said. And not only that, but to be heard, which is more of an issue I think, than accusing the guy of things that he is not. He backs up everything he talked about with real life examples in which he had to confront hostile or negative people responding to his brand of humor.

1136,15523010,"The show started a bit slow, with some jokes that, Chappelle style, were trying to ostensibly offend in a humorous way but also set up something. I didn't know what he was trying to set up, I didn't know what he was trying to say, but I distinctly thought to myself: has anyone hugged Dave lately? The man needs a hug. And I didn't know why, I just knew that he had real pain on his face - and I am the guy who couldn't care less about the feelings of others most of the time, so that is saying something.Before he started talking about Daphne, he talked about how annoying he found people who were judging him based on a famous piece on him, using the same lingo and addressing only the talking points in that article, and I felt a little awkward because I hadn't watched The Closer for a while just because of the various news items about people hating on Chappelle or him going too far against the trans people and so on. I didn't really need the aggravation, you see, I wanted to feel safe. But it hit me that I was watching the show with some preconceptions already formed, and not formed voluntarily. I was waiting for the scathing jokes about trans people, the offensive words, the heartless comments, curious if I will feel he went too far or laugh my ass off.And what I got was the opposite of that: a thoughtful, soulful, emotional and honest piece about what it means to be human. I can't imagine the kind of deranged people that would get offended at this show - though remember most psychopaths are not smart at all - yet I can understand why the outragey Twitterati posing as one minority or another to do their evil would be afraid of The Closer.

1149,15523010,"Dave has always been current, provocative, and funny asf and all in a good way since his days on the Chapelle show.Then in 2020, he got a bit serious and perhaps a bit angrier with a show or two when we needed him the most during the riots, which was a bit of a disappointment to me. I thought he had lost his edge. However, The Closer showed that he didn't lose his edge, but is back in a strong sense with NFG.This was so refreshing to see a comedian talk about whatever topic and not worry if he would get canceled.

1152,15523010,"I'm always amazed with Chappelle. He's funny, insightful and says what everyone is afraid to. Because he's not black and white on issues, he's grey. And in these times, that's not easy to do. And it's never easy to do because it requires you to open up and reveal what you really think. And not conform to what your group thinks. To do this you have to be a maverick. And it's not easy.In these times of social media cliques, outrage, oversensitivity and cancel culture to have your own opinion isn't acceptable. Each side wants you to agree without question or else you're the enemy. Well I have my own thoughts and I see the holes in many of these causes. That not everybody that identifies with them is genuine And so does Chappelle. And I agree with almost everything he says. It's nice to see someone else saying it to know that I'm not alone. I'm sure others feel the same way. And that's why we need Dave. He thinks what I think and says it much better than I could and makes it funny. And puts it ways that I could never articulate or think of like him. Dave's a smart guy. He looks at things and questions them. He doesn't close his eyes and repeat what he's supposed to. To think that Dave is transphobic only means one thing: you aren't listening. And that's exactly what's wrong with these days. No one is really listening.So many of us are supportive of everything gay but are confused by the ever changing meanings of definitions and the whole trans thing in general. I don't understand it completely but I do the best I can. No matter what I'll be supportive, because a human is still a human and I'll never discriminate. And there needs to be dialogue between us to help understand. There isn't going to be when the standard is that we can't even ask questions without being branded as the enemy.I question every part of life. They're no different. People shouldn't follow with blind acceptance. You should always think about life and the meanings behind everything for yourself. And Dave is the only one brave enough to do this in public. Every single person I know is accepting but confused. And they're all afraid to bring it up to other's because they don't want to be called a Nazi. When I bring it up to friends they are so happy that they aren't alone with their thoughts. And they are always supportive but confused and it's nice to talk about it to find a better understanding and not feel alone. And why do we usually start talking about this? A Chappelle stand up special.We need people that are brave enough to reflect the voice of people instead of living in this world of fear where everyone is afraid to ask questions to better understand something. Lying about human behavior isn't going to get us anywhere. Repression is never good. Especially out of fear. Let's not forget that straight people are the majority. The trans are the minority. They're even a minority of a minority. The internet would have you believe this is reversed.Not the funniest of his specials but it's not like his jokes fail. It's just not as funny as some others. It's just as good. It's almost not the point to laugh. Dave is talking about real stuff and it's funny along the way.And another thing. Just because one trans person or person from a group says they feel a certain way about something, that doesn't represent the entire group. The internet loves to do this but we all have our own thoughts no matter what race, religion or sex we are.",0,,ur5750535,7 October 2021,0,1.0,310,200,5.838709677419355,0.6451612903225806,"('think', 5)('hes', 4)('funny', 4)('says', 4)('never', 4)('dave', 4)('one', 4)('people', 4)('im', 3)('always', 3)","['im', 'always', 'amazed', 'chappelle', 'hes', 'funny', 'insightful', 'says', 'everyone', 'afraid', 'hes', 'black', 'white', 'issues', 'hes', 'grey', 'times', 'thats', 'easy', 'never', 'easy', 'requires', 'open', 'reveal', 'really', 'think', 'conform', 'group', 'thinks', 'maverick', 'easyin', 'times', 'social', 'media', 'cliques', 'outrage', 'oversensitivity', 'cancel', 'culture', 'opinion', 'isnt', 'acceptable', 'side', 'wants', 'agree', 'without', 'question', 'else', 'youre', 'enemy', 'well', 'thoughts', 'see', 'holes', 'many', 'causes', 'everybody', 'identifies', 'genuine', 'chappelle', 'agree', 'almost', 'everything', 'says', 'nice', 'see', 'someone', 'else', 'saying', 'know', 'im', 'alone', 'im', 'sure', 'others', 'feel', 'way', 'thats', 'need', 'dave', 'thinks', 'think', 'says', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'makes', 'funny', 'puts', 'ways', 'could', 'never', 'articulate', 'think', 'like', 'daves', 'smart', 'guy', 'looks', 'things', 'questions', 'doesnt', 'close', 'eyes', 'repeat', 'hes', 'supposed', 'think', 'dave', 'transphobic', 'means', 'one', 'thing', 'arent', 'listening', 'thats', 'exactly', 'whats', 'wrong', 'days', 'one', 'really', 'listeningso', 'many', 'us', 'supportive', 'everything', 'gay', 'confused', 'ever', 'changing', 'meanings', 'definitions', 'whole', 'trans', 'thing', 'general', 'dont', 'understand', 'completely', 'best', 'matter', 'ill', 'supportive', 'human', 'still', 'human', 'ill', 'never', 'discriminate', 'needs', 'dialogue', 'us', 'help', 'understand', 'isnt', 'going', 'standard', 'cant', 'even', 'ask', 'questions', 'without', 'branded', 'enemyi', 'question', 'every', 'part', 'life', 'theyre', 'different', 'people', 'shouldnt', 'follow', 'blind', 'acceptance', 'always', 'think', 'life', 'meanings', 'behind', 'everything', 'dave', 'one', 'brave', 'enough', 'public', 'every', 'single', 'person', 'know', 'accepting', 'confused', 'theyre', 'afraid', 'bring', 'others', 'dont', 'want', 'called', 'nazi', 'bring', 'friends', 'happy', 'arent', 'alone', 'thoughts', 'always', 'supportive', 'confused', 'nice', 'talk', 'find', 'better', 'understanding', 'feel', 'alone', 'usually', 'start', 'talking', 'chappelle', 'stand', 'specialwe', 'need', 'people', 'brave', 'enough', 'reflect', 'voice', 'people', 'instead', 'living', 'world', 'fear', 'everyone', 'afraid', 'ask', 'questions', 'better', 'understand', 'something', 'lying', 'human', 'behavior', 'isnt', 'going', 'get', 'us', 'anywhere', 'repression', 'never', 'good', 'especially', 'fear', 'lets', 'forget', 'straight', 'people', 'majority', 'trans', 'minority', 'theyre', 'even', 'minority', 'minority', 'internet', 'would', 'believe', 'reversednot', 'funniest', 'specials', 'like', 'jokes', 'fail', 'funny', 'others', 'good', 'almost', 'point', 'laugh', 'dave', 'talking', 'real', 'stuff', 'funny', 'along', 'wayand', 'another', 'thing', 'one', 'trans', 'person', 'person', 'group', 'says', 'feel', 'certain', 'way', 'something', 'doesnt', 'represent', 'entire', 'group', 'internet', 'loves', 'thoughts', 'matter', 'race', 'religion', 'sex']"

And frankly, if there's anything I find surprising about the controversy, it's that the trans community seems to be the only minority group giving Dave Chappelle some rightfully deserved pushback for this.Because while I know the vast majority of trans people do not appreciate being misgendered, reminded that their genitals aren't what they want them to be, told that they make people uncomfortable in public toilets, or called tr*nnies (even if your dead trans friend was okay with all that, Dave, and yes this does all happen in this), I also know that Asian people do not like being compared to COVID, Jewish people do not like the suggestion that they secretly want to take over the world, and feminists do not like the assumption that they are all ""frumpy d*kes""I'm not joking when I say that I now slightly regret criticising Bo Burnham's What for having some jokes that felt a bit edgy, because this trash could have come straight out of the early 2000s and no one would have been the least bit surprised. I have no damn clue what, if any, larger point was being made here, and I laughed one single time, and that was because Chappelle told a joke that someone else made up.And while I'm talking up Bo Burnham yet again, I feel the need to mention that while I don't know whether the ""salt and vi..."" joke from Make Happy would fly nowadays, you can't deny that it was really goddamn clever, and I'm willing to bet that even if you were offended by it, you at least allowed yourself a little chuckle the first time you saw it. This garbage can't even be clever or amusing, which is the least you could do if you're basically going to center your comedy special on insulting every minority group except your own under the sun in the Western world.So screw this special, and Netflix should be goddamn ashamed that they ever even considered hosting it on their platform, especially - and I really cannot stress this enough - in the same year that Bo Burnham's Inside dropped, which is not just a great comedy special, but one that redefined what a comedy special could be, and is easily my favourite film of the year (if you can call it that), and I really do not expect that to change, either.Meanwhile the only difference between this and the edgy kid telling offensive jokes in your science class back in 2014 is perhaps the worst thing about this, come to think of it: at least the edgy kid is just doing it for attention, and likely doesn't have any delusions of grandeur, the intolerable ego, or notion that he's somehow making some grand statement that just needed to be said like this idiot does.",0,,ur96762914,17 October 2021,0,,253,194,5.857707509881423,0.766798418972332,"('people', 5)('bo', 4)('even', 4)('like', 4)('least', 4)('special', 4)('burnhams', 3)('year', 3)('trans', 3)('know', 3)","['holy', 'wank', 'antichrist', 'bo', 'burnhams', 'holy', 'childits', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'discourse', 'surrounding', 'last', 'week', 'especially', 'seeing', 'tiktok', 'adhd', 'app', 'choice', 'year', 'people', 'happy', 'frankly', 'theres', 'anything', 'find', 'surprising', 'controversy', 'trans', 'community', 'seems', 'minority', 'group', 'giving', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'rightfully', 'deserved', 'pushback', 'thisbecause', 'know', 'vast', 'majority', 'trans', 'people', 'appreciate', 'misgendered', 'reminded', 'genitals', 'arent', 'want', 'told', 'make', 'people', 'uncomfortable', 'public', 'toilets', 'called', 'trnnies', 'even', 'dead', 'trans', 'friend', 'okay', 'dave', 'yes', 'happen', 'also', 'know', 'asian', 'people', 'like', 'compared', 'covid', 'jewish', 'people', 'like', 'suggestion', 'secretly', 'want', 'take', 'world', 'feminists', 'like', 'assumption', 'frumpy', 'dkesim', 'joking', 'say', 'slightly', 'regret', 'criticising', 'bo', 'burnhams', 'jokes', 'felt', 'bit', 'edgy', 'trash', 'could', 'come', 'straight', 'early', 'one', 'would', 'least', 'bit', 'surprised', 'damn', 'clue', 'larger', 'point', 'made', 'laughed', 'one', 'single', 'time', 'chappelle', 'told', 'joke', 'someone', 'else', 'made', 'upand', 'im', 'talking', 'bo', 'burnham', 'yet', 'feel', 'need', 'mention', 'dont', 'know', 'whether', 'salt', 'vi', 'joke', 'make', 'happy', 'would', 'fly', 'nowadays', 'cant', 'deny', 'really', 'goddamn', 'clever', 'im', 'willing', 'bet', 'even', 'offended', 'least', 'allowed', 'little', 'chuckle', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'garbage', 'cant', 'even', 'clever', 'amusing', 'least', 'could', 'youre', 'basically', 'going', 'center', 'comedy', 'special', 'insulting', 'every', 'minority', 'group', 'except', 'sun', 'western', 'worldso', 'screw', 'special', 'netflix', 'goddamn', 'ashamed', 'ever', 'even', 'considered', 'hosting', 'platform', 'especially', 'really', 'cannot', 'stress', 'enough', 'year', 'bo', 'burnhams', 'inside', 'dropped', 'great', 'comedy', 'special', 'one', 'redefined', 'comedy', 'special', 'could', 'easily', 'favourite', 'film', 'year', 'call', 'really', 'expect', 'change', 'eithermeanwhile', 'difference', 'edgy', 'kid', 'telling', 'offensive', 'jokes', 'science', 'class', 'back', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'thing', 'come', 'think', 'least', 'edgy', 'kid', 'attention', 'likely', 'doesnt', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'intolerable', 'ego', 'notion', 'hes', 'somehow', 'making', 'grand', 'statement', 'needed', 'said', 'like', 'idiot']"

1165,11168100,"I feel like I need to preface this review w an honest statement that I love basically everything about Seth Meyers & always have. Even the word 'basically' is questionable - I can't think of anything I don't love about him. So much so that some nights I only watch Late Night for the first 15 or so minutes because I will never (& HAVE never) miss Seth's monologues & topical commentary/comedy skits/parodies on the off chance that I just don't have time to watch the whole show. I have never missed even one of his opening bits or a single 'weekend update' piece & even his early improv, the little bit that you might find if you search really well, is totally solid. I also think he was the second best writer ever on SNL, second only to Tina Fey - pretty good company, right?That being said, I was prepared to be at least slightly disappointed w his stand up. I've often thought about seeing him live but it's somewhat rare & usually nowhere near where I live. Plus, honestly, I get to enjoy him 5 nights a week (ok, that 'hinted suggestion' is a bit over the top, but it's another reason I love Seth - anyone who looks that good & is also that funny is just so lovable). So for what it's worth, I thoroughly enjoyed a fantastic hour watching one of my absolute favorite humans do some of the best stand up I've seen. Something about him is so entirely entertaining & witty, yet so easily relatable. Because of his relationship w his family (who DOESN'T love Larry, Hilary & Josh?), his undeniable respect for his wife Alexi & obvious love for his boys, I just can't imagine anyone not liking him. That's part of what's so great about this special - It's just 'Seth being Seth', but instead of monologues or lead ins & punchlines you get solid stand up. Also, admittedly, it's kind of fun to hear him drop a few F-bombs without being 'bleeped'. I'm not saying this is for everyone, some people may not like Seth (how that's possible I don't know, but to each his/her own, I suppose) - but if you like Late Night w Seth Meyers, if you liked him on SNL & you find him funny in general you will undoubtedly thoroughly enjoy this Netflix special. As I said, I was prepared to be disappointed because the bar was set so high (my own doing, but I'll blame him for being SO off the charts talented) but I was anything but disappointed. This is just GREAT stand up.That being said, it's not my absolute FAVORITE standup show ever - people who JUST do stand up are often SO well prepared, have perfect timing & truly have their craft down pat, but it is definitely fantastic stand up & given all his other talents, I was surprised to see that he is simply so very good at stand up.Check this out people, you won't be disappointed.

He begins his routine by immediately going political: about the Persian Gulf War, he says, ""It's first war we've had that was on every news channel, plus cable. We like war because we're a war-like people (...) We're good at it. And it's a good thing we are, we're not very good at anything else anymore!"" With this he begins his attack on how we as a nation can bomb other countries, especially ""brown people"" (except Germans, and only because they were trying to 'cut in on our action.'). He talks about being his own person, someone who thinks for himself, and about how war is about ""prick-waving"" and nothing else. And seeing it today as yesterday it makes sense: all he's pointing the finger at is on the general situation and where we're headed, and no one is better than he in making war as a concept a sexual thing and an issue of manhood.But he soon gets the political stuff out of the way, and goes into dissertations on embarrassing situations -- the trivial things we go through -- which are flat-out funny. No one better than Carlin to talk about how when there are times when you're coming up the stairs and think there is one extra step, or when you've woken up and not known which day it was. And of course, his forte: language, and our misuse or over use of it for things that don't need such technicality. Who better than he to talk about the minutiae of airplane instructions?

This guy knew how to tell it like it is. It is what made this particular stand-up comedian so unique. GC was not just about making his audience laugh. Any personified whoopee cushion atop a stage can do that. Carlin has been dubbed the thinking man's comic, and rightly so.I was curious to see how much of Carlin's material in JAMMIN' IN NEW YORK has stood the test of time and so re-viewed it in order to find that out. Much to my surprise, very little of it is outdated. About the only talk that is is the stuff about war in the Persian Gulf. This was one of his earlier live events, back when men wore pleated pants and ponytails. The latter happens to be a pet peeve of mine, but I digress.In the news of late, in certain parts of the globe, is this politicized clampdown on -- forget political graft, deceit, and corruption for a moment -- plastic of all things, which brings to mind one of the monologues contained here, titled ""The Planet Is Fine."" Very timely, this.Carlin also goes on about syntax and the hairsplitting of terminology as it applies to air travel, and as one who chooses to occasionally ignore conventional grammar himself for common sense, this bit was both identifiable and much appreciated.Superfluous wording. Ah, yes. Carlin notes how some people prefer to use highfalutin terms in order to make something sound more important than it actually is. Like the other week when I passed by a ""hydration station"" (i.e. water cooler). A mouth-watering term to any language-loving enunciator, but needlessly uppity-sounding to say the least.There is some constructive criticizing of the government, which is what democratic dissent is all about. The part about how those in power often seek to divide the people is something very few comics would go into, but Carlin does. He also has some unflattering things to say about environmentalists.Not every joke or observation goes over well. At least not with me. As one who likes to golf, I found Carlin's derisive remarks in regard to this particular pastime way off the mark. But considering we're both into free speech, I would rather he be free to voice erroneous and unfunny comments from time to time than be censored.Incidentally, I think Carlin's incorrect when he says that the term pre-recorded is a redundancy. This HBO special, for instance, was recorded in real time whereas, say, episodes of televised sitcoms are usually recorded beforehand, to be aired at a later date -- that is to say, they are pre-recorded. Getting analytical here, I know. Just saying.Overall, JAMMIN' IN NEW YORK is quite groovy and for the most part remarkably dateless. I can do without all the observational humor and there is some of that here as well. Carlin is at his best whenever he's on a riff or a rant and the least interesting when he resorts to body English and the making of funny faces. But I suppose some in the audience who are only amused by slapstick-like fare would find this entertaining and such ones are not left out from enjoying the show.

1248,0084597,"How do you top your own legend? In Richard Pryor ""Live on the Sunset Strip"" (1982), Pryor doesn't quite make it -- but he comes awfully close.A bit of background for the uninitiated: Pryor, already a huge success via his earthy 1970's comedy albums, made film history with ""Richard Pryor Live in Concert."" A modestly filmed recording of a 1979 concert he did in Long Beach, CA., it put many of that year's Hollywood blockbusters to shame with its rich characterizations and incisiveness; countless comics still cite it as their impetus for doing comedy.Unfortunately, Pryor was a volatile man with a severe drug habit. About a year after the concert film was released, Pryor was freebasing and caught himself on fire. (He later acknowledged it as a suicide attempt.) Therapy and cosmetic surgery helped to restore him, but it left him with a quandary: How does a comic whose act was based on fear and hostility acknowledge the love and support of his audience? Unlike its ground-breaking predecessor, the '82 film takes a while to get going. The credits, as simple as they are (Pryor produced the film and wrote the material), seem to last forever. And there's more longeur when Pryor makes his way to the stage via the audience, who can't stop their standing ovation and glad-handing of him.When he does finally reach the spotlight, Pryor appears a bit unsettled at first. The '79 film showed Pryor prowling the stage, his shirt visibly drenched in perspiration. In ""Sunset Strip,"" he's dressed nattily in a flaming red suit -- ostensibly intended as a visual pun on his fire incident, but so spiffy that even he acknowledges that it ill-suits him. He initially throws out random observations, hoping something will stick.He finally hits his stride in a riff about male-female relationships, both casual (his encounter with a Playboy Bunny who gets turned on when Pryor does kiddie voices) and emotional (he tearfully calls up a recently estranged girlfriend who coolly advises him, ""Don't do this to yourself""). He also hits pay dirt with his account of filming the 1980 comedy ""Stir Crazy"" at the Arizona State Penitentiary; at first he is moved by the plight of his black ""brothers"" until he is apprised of their graphic crimes, at which point he declares, ""Thank God...we got...penitentiaries!"" He also does a great routine about a recent visit to Africa, in which he imitates jungle animals in the manner of the menagerie of impersonations in his '79 film. After this, he begins to soften, as he realizes that his homeland visit has caused him to forever negate his use of the notorious N-word. He follows this with what he claims is ""the final appearance"" of his street character Mudbone (Pryor lied; he revived the character in his third concert film), who chides his creator Pryor for his fire incident. Critic Pauline Kael was put off by these passages, saying in essence that Pryor was kissing up to his audience with these observations. She might have been on to something, but considering that this comic narrowly escaped death and found some lacerating revelations on the other side, perhaps he was entitled to a little self-indulgence.All of this, naturally, leads to the movie's showpiece: Pryor's account of his 1980 immolation. He prefaces it with a joke about how it ""really"" happened: When he had milk and cookies in bed one night, he mixed whole milk with skim milk, ""and the s*** blew up!"" But when he launches into the true account of the events leading up to and following the fire, he pulls no punches. His gift for bringing inanimate objects to life gets downright eerie when he does the voice of his reassuring freebase pipe, which he came to regard as his only true friend. When I saw this movie upon its initial release, I sat open-mouthed at this routine, unable to laugh -- but not because it was poorly done. On the contrary, it was so forthright and honest that it went beyond comedy, to a point where you could imagine Pryor observing his self-destructive behavior from outside of himself. (Indeed, that was the approach Pryor took when he dramatized the incident in his autobiographical 1986 movie ""Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling."") Pryor lived for over two decades after this movie, until multiple sclerosis permanently stilled his demons. But in 1982, ""Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip"" inspired well-earned laughter as well as gratitude that a rich talent such as Pryor was still with us. The movie still stands as a remarkable comedic document -- not quite as great as its '79 predecessor, but still head and shoulders above most of the brain-dead comedy from then and now.",0,,ur38201586,10 January 2013,0,,405,326,6.412345679012346,0.8049382716049382,"('pryor', 19)('film', 7)('comedy', 4)('concert', 4)('still', 4)('fire', 4)('movie', 4)('richard', 3)('live', 3)('sunset', 3)","['top', 'legend', 'richard', 'pryor', 'live', 'sunset', 'strip', 'pryor', 'doesnt', 'quite', 'make', 'comes', 'awfully', 'closea', 'bit', 'background', 'uninitiated', 'pryor', 'already', 'huge', 'success', 'via', 'earthy', 'comedy', 'albums', 'made', 'film', 'history', 'richard', 'pryor', 'live', 'concert', 'modestly', 'filmed', 'recording', 'concert', 'long', 'beach', 'ca', 'put', 'many', 'years', 'hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'shame', 'rich', 'characterizations', 'incisiveness', 'countless', 'comics', 'still', 'cite', 'impetus', 'comedyunfortunately', 'pryor', 'volatile', 'man', 'severe', 'drug', 'habit', 'year', 'concert', 'film', 'released', 'pryor', 'freebasing', 'caught', 'fire', 'later', 'acknowledged', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'therapy', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'helped', 'restore', 'left', 'quandary', 'comic', 'whose', 'act', 'based', 'fear', 'hostility', 'acknowledge', 'love', 'support', 'audience', 'unlike', 'groundbreaking', 'predecessor', 'film', 'takes', 'get', 'going', 'credits', 'simple', 'pryor', 'produced', 'film', 'wrote', 'material', 'seem', 'last', 'forever', 'theres', 'longeur', 'pryor', 'makes', 'way', 'stage', 'via', 'audience', 'cant', 'stop', 'standing', 'ovation', 'gladhanding', 'himwhen', 'finally', 'reach', 'spotlight', 'pryor', 'appears', 'bit', 'unsettled', 'first', 'film', 'showed', 'pryor', 'prowling', 'stage', 'shirt', 'visibly', 'drenched', 'perspiration', 'sunset', 'strip', 'hes', 'dressed', 'nattily', 'flaming', 'red', 'suit', 'ostensibly', 'intended', 'visual', 'pun', 'fire', 'incident', 'spiffy', 'even', 'acknowledges', 'illsuits', 'initially', 'throws', 'random', 'observations', 'hoping', 'something', 'stickhe', 'finally', 'hits', 'stride', 'riff', 'malefemale', 'relationships', 'casual', 'encounter', 'playboy', 'bunny', 'gets', 'turned', 'pryor', 'kiddie', 'voices', 'emotional', 'tearfully', 'calls', 'recently', 'estranged', 'girlfriend', 'coolly', 'advises', 'dont', 'also', 'hits', 'pay', 'dirt', 'account', 'filming', 'comedy', 'stir', 'crazy', 'arizona', 'state', 'penitentiary', 'first', 'moved', 'plight', 'black', 'brothers', 'apprised', 'graphic', 'crimes', 'point', 'declares', 'thank', 'godwe', 'gotpenitentiaries', 'also', 'great', 'routine', 'recent', 'visit', 'africa', 'imitates', 'jungle', 'animals', 'manner', 'menagerie', 'impersonations', 'film', 'begins', 'soften', 'realizes', 'homeland', 'visit', 'caused', 'forever', 'negate', 'use', 'notorious', 'nword', 'follows', 'claims', 'final', 'appearance', 'street', 'character', 'mudbone', 'pryor', 'lied', 'revived', 'character', 'third', 'concert', 'film', 'chides', 'creator', 'pryor', 'fire', 'incident', 'critic', 'pauline', 'kael', 'put', 'passages', 'saying', 'essence', 'pryor', 'kissing', 'audience', 'observations', 'might', 'something', 'considering', 'comic', 'narrowly', 'escaped', 'death', 'found', 'lacerating', 'revelations', 'side', 'perhaps', 'entitled', 'little', 'selfindulgenceall', 'naturally', 'leads', 'movies', 'showpiece', 'pryors', 'account', 'immolation', 'prefaces', 'joke', 'really', 'happened', 'milk', 'cookies', 'bed', 'one', 'night', 'mixed', 'whole', 'milk', 'skim', 'milk', 'blew', 'launches', 'true', 'account', 'events', 'leading', 'following', 'fire', 'pulls', 'punches', 'gift', 'bringing', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'life', 'gets', 'downright', 'eerie', 'voice', 'reassuring', 'freebase', 'pipe', 'came', 'regard', 'true', 'friend', 'saw', 'movie', 'upon', 'initial', 'release', 'sat', 'openmouthed', 'routine', 'unable', 'laugh', 'poorly', 'done', 'contrary', 'forthright', 'honest', 'went', 'beyond', 'comedy', 'point', 'could', 'imagine', 'pryor', 'observing', 'selfdestructive', 'behavior', 'outside', 'indeed', 'approach', 'pryor', 'took', 'dramatized', 'incident', 'autobiographical', 'movie', 'jo', 'jo', 'dancer', 'life', 'calling', 'pryor', 'lived', 'two', 'decades', 'movie', 'multiple', 'sclerosis', 'permanently', 'stilled', 'demons', 'richard', 'pryor', 'live', 'sunset', 'strip', 'inspired', 'wellearned', 'laughter', 'well', 'gratitude', 'rich', 'talent', 'pryor', 'still', 'us', 'movie', 'still', 'stands', 'remarkable', 'comedic', 'document', 'quite', 'great', 'predecessor', 'still', 'head', 'shoulders', 'braindead', 'comedy']"

I was all bandaged up in Hospital and came on the news, Richard Pryor died five minutes ago, i shouted noooooooooooo! wait on a minute jack""It is equally interesting to take note of how many other comedians have ""Borrowed"" drom Pryor over the years. For instance, Billy Connoly has quite often used the self mocking humour that Pryor uses to full swing here, and Eddie Murphy is on a much stronger level prone to using the black angst in his performance. Richard Pryor does it better than both here, and Live at the Sunset Strip is an absolute Stand Up Cinema Comedy classic.",0,,ur1581456,27 February 2002,0,,163,143,5.877300613496932,0.8773006134969326,"('pryor', 8)('richard', 3)('live', 2)('sunset', 2)('strip', 2)('best', 2)('interesting', 2)('made', 2)('burn', 2)('way', 2)","['opinion', 'richard', 'pryor', 'live', 'sunset', 'strip', 'funniest', 'best', 'example', 'genius', 'work', 'doubly', 'interesting', 'consider', 'made', 'long', 'pryors', 'burn', 'accident', 'use', 'way', 'speaking', 'despite', 'pryor', 'hasnt', 'point', 'lost', 'inventiveness', 'imagination', 'wich', 'made', 'one', 'original', 'freshest', 'warm', 'comedians', 'perhaps', 'top', 'gear', 'best', 'comedian', 'world', 'audience', 'really', 'responds', 'hanging', 'every', 'word', 'wanting', 'well', 'way', 'watch', 'pryor', 'opens', 'monologues', 'hysterical', 'stories', 'machine', 'gun', 'pace', 'belly', 'laughs', 'gauranted', 'pryor', 'doesnt', 'dodge', 'anything', 'retelling', 'side', 'acing', 'tales', 'run', 'ins', 'mafia', 'making', 'stir', 'crazy', 'discovery', 'masturbation', 'interestingly', 'humorous', 'exploding', 'incident', 'brothers', 'free', 'based', 'many', 'know', 'blew', 'started', 'burn', 'high', 'didnt', 'even', 'know', 'happening', 'looked', 'hand', 'fire', 'thought', 'hey', 'thats', 'pretty', 'blue', 'bandaged', 'hospital', 'came', 'news', 'richard', 'pryor', 'died', 'five', 'minutes', 'ago', 'shouted', 'noooooooooooo', 'wait', 'minute', 'jackit', 'equally', 'interesting', 'take', 'note', 'many', 'comedians', 'borrowed', 'drom', 'pryor', 'years', 'instance', 'billy', 'connoly', 'quite', 'often', 'used', 'self', 'mocking', 'humour', 'pryor', 'uses', 'full', 'swing', 'eddie', 'murphy', 'much', 'stronger', 'level', 'prone', 'using', 'black', 'angst', 'performance', 'richard', 'pryor', 'better', 'live', 'sunset', 'strip', 'absolute', 'stand', 'cinema', 'comedy', 'classic']"

1299,7806998,"I will concede that there are limits to good taste.. but something really has to be crass for me to be offended. If a comedian was an obvious misogynist and glorified rape, I would be disgusted. If a comedian riffed on ""hilarity"" of child abuse, I would get up and walk out. But when a brilliant writer of comedy, with perfect timing and impeccable delivery, that has charisma and a rapport with the audience, has us laughing at ourselves over the idiosyncrasies of our race, gender, religion, economic standing, etc., then I am totally entertained and not the slightest bit offended.. because THIS is what makes comedy comedy! Finding humor in our humanness is the very core of comedy, and has always been the stem from which comedy sprouts.Chappelle is, as others have pointed out (and I can think of no better descriptive) the Master of stand-up! I laughed my ample derriere off from start to finish - all the while in awe of Dave's brilliant mind. His humor is topical and relevant, and it's obvious, to anyone who doesn't view life as deadpan serious, that he is the consummate ""Every-man"".. meaning, he has a way of relating to, and appreciating, every kind of human being. That's important in comedy.A successful comic must have the skill to extract and exploit the nuances of social behavior if they want to make people laugh. If you think you're going to be entertained by a comic getting up on stage and cracking jokes about the weather, or their dog's cute antics.. well, you might chuckle.. but you're not going to choke on your popcorn and laugh so hard that you cry, like you would if he (or she) did a bit about a behavior that is unique to you or your respective group. (For example, how Italians can't talk without making wild hand gestures, or how Canadians punctuate every other statement with an ""eh?"" We all - most of us, anyway - get a big kick out of seeing someone ""do"" us). Think of the difference between a caricaturist who over-emphasizes the subject's big ears and jowls, and minimizes his tiny chin - vs a caricaturist who draws a perfect likeness of the subject. The latter is just not funny. (Nor a caricaturist). Representative art can be skillful, but does not usually evoke any emotions. Might as well take a photograph.I will always choose a Dave Chappelle routine over pretty much any other comedian. He's spectacularly funny, but he's also a man of depth. He brings up the point in this special, about how difficult it is for a performer to say or do anything in today's world without offending someone (and I would like to add, often with life-affecting repercussions). Sadly, he's not wrong. I hope our social climate becomes more tolerable in the near future, and that he returns to the stage to entertain those of us who understand the difference between satire and reality.",0,,ur1333366,21 October 2020,0,1.0,243,200,6.345679012345679,0.823045267489712,"('comedy', 5)('would', 4)('us', 4)('comedian', 3)('think', 3)('caricaturist', 3)('hes', 3)('offended', 2)('obvious', 2)('get', 2)","['concede', 'limits', 'good', 'taste', 'something', 'really', 'crass', 'offended', 'comedian', 'obvious', 'misogynist', 'glorified', 'rape', 'would', 'disgusted', 'comedian', 'riffed', 'hilarity', 'child', 'abuse', 'would', 'get', 'walk', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'comedy', 'perfect', 'timing', 'impeccable', 'delivery', 'charisma', 'rapport', 'audience', 'us', 'laughing', 'idiosyncrasies', 'race', 'gender', 'religion', 'economic', 'standing', 'etc', 'totally', 'entertained', 'slightest', 'bit', 'offended', 'makes', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'finding', 'humor', 'humanness', 'core', 'comedy', 'always', 'stem', 'comedy', 'sproutschappelle', 'others', 'pointed', 'think', 'better', 'descriptive', 'master', 'standup', 'laughed', 'ample', 'derriere', 'start', 'finish', 'awe', 'daves', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'humor', 'topical', 'relevant', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'doesnt', 'view', 'life', 'deadpan', 'serious', 'consummate', 'everyman', 'meaning', 'way', 'relating', 'appreciating', 'every', 'kind', 'human', 'thats', 'important', 'comedya', 'successful', 'comic', 'must', 'skill', 'extract', 'exploit', 'nuances', 'social', 'behavior', 'want', 'make', 'people', 'laugh', 'think', 'youre', 'going', 'entertained', 'comic', 'getting', 'stage', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'weather', 'dogs', 'cute', 'antics', 'well', 'might', 'chuckle', 'youre', 'going', 'choke', 'popcorn', 'laugh', 'hard', 'cry', 'like', 'would', 'bit', 'behavior', 'unique', 'respective', 'group', 'example', 'italians', 'cant', 'talk', 'without', 'making', 'wild', 'hand', 'gestures', 'canadians', 'punctuate', 'every', 'statement', 'eh', 'us', 'anyway', 'get', 'big', 'kick', 'seeing', 'someone', 'us', 'think', 'difference', 'caricaturist', 'overemphasizes', 'subjects', 'big', 'ears', 'jowls', 'minimizes', 'tiny', 'chin', 'vs', 'caricaturist', 'draws', 'perfect', 'likeness', 'subject', 'latter', 'funny', 'caricaturist', 'representative', 'art', 'skillful', 'usually', 'evoke', 'emotions', 'might', 'well', 'take', 'photographi', 'always', 'choose', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'routine', 'pretty', 'much', 'comedian', 'hes', 'spectacularly', 'funny', 'hes', 'also', 'man', 'depth', 'brings', 'point', 'special', 'difficult', 'performer', 'say', 'anything', 'todays', 'world', 'without', 'offending', 'someone', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'often', 'lifeaffecting', 'repercussions', 'sadly', 'hes', 'wrong', 'hope', 'social', 'climate', 'becomes', 'tolerable', 'near', 'future', 'returns', 'stage', 'entertain', 'us', 'understand', 'difference', 'satire', 'reality']"

It doesn't have a consistent pace of any sort, and doesn't really maintain my interest. I think part of its exposure is that Louie does so much of the work in the show, straight to the editing. I don't think any of it is well-deserved. Hilarious by Louie C.K. however, is stand-up art. His routine, which doesn't translate as well on television, works perfectly here as he engages with the audience, shocks the audience, and leaves them consistently laughing throughout the entire movie. There isn't much of a rhythm and flow to Louie C.K.'s comedy unlike that of Gabriel Iglesias and even Kevin Hart. His topics jump from one end of the spectrum to the next, and that is what makes his comedy appealing—the unpredictability of it all. There will be physical humor in the form of an elongated sequence in which he---well, you'll see; and then there will be excellent real-world observations like America's inability to accept that the evolving technology is nothing short of amazing. He observes the real world, talks about his family, and discusses his private life as well. But within these typical stand-up topics you'll get plenty of angry raunchy humor that is inches away from just being purely anarchic. Louis C.K. is a new-age George Carlin, one that uses exaggeratory words, phrases, and statements to make his point—and will not be afraid of an abundance of strong words to help deliver the message. The beauty of Hilarious is that you can step in at any given point in the movie and never truly feel lost. His stage is very simple, the camera work is very simple, and it's just Louis C.K. running the show and absorbing all the attention. Even his wardrobe is extremely simple: t-shirt and jeans. It adds to his comedy—he looks like a simple middle-aged man that can spark interesting topics while throw in some toilet humor just in case you get bored. Louis C.K.'s best comedy mainly and solely comes from his stand-up as opposed to his extracurricular activities----just like Kevin Hart. And Hilarious is easily one of his best works, and never veers you away from the stage. It is pessimistic, crude, rude, exaggerated, and quietly out-of-control. And it works in every possible level. The ultimate joke is that Louis C.K. is a very intelligent man, but he will never pass off as that with his persona, his choice of words, and uncaring attitude. While his show is nowhere near to be decent, you can't argue against his stage presence in the least bit—he is among the best in the business.",0,,ur3387663,29 August 2014,0,,238,182,6.07563025210084,0.7647058823529411,"('louie', 4)('show', 4)('ck', 4)('louis', 4)('simple', 4)('think', 3)('doesnt', 3)('hilarious', 3)('standup', 3)('works', 3)","['fan', 'louie', 'think', 'show', 'rather', 'slow', 'bloated', 'lifeless', 'charmless', 'utterly', 'pretentious', 'doesnt', 'consistent', 'pace', 'sort', 'doesnt', 'really', 'maintain', 'interest', 'think', 'part', 'exposure', 'louie', 'much', 'work', 'show', 'straight', 'editing', 'dont', 'think', 'welldeserved', 'hilarious', 'louie', 'ck', 'however', 'standup', 'art', 'routine', 'doesnt', 'translate', 'well', 'television', 'works', 'perfectly', 'engages', 'audience', 'shocks', 'audience', 'leaves', 'consistently', 'laughing', 'throughout', 'entire', 'movie', 'isnt', 'much', 'rhythm', 'flow', 'louie', 'cks', 'comedy', 'unlike', 'gabriel', 'iglesias', 'even', 'kevin', 'hart', 'topics', 'jump', 'one', 'end', 'spectrum', 'next', 'makes', 'comedy', 'unpredictability', 'physical', 'humor', 'form', 'elongated', 'sequence', 'hewell', 'youll', 'see', 'excellent', 'realworld', 'observations', 'like', 'americas', 'inability', 'accept', 'evolving', 'technology', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'observes', 'real', 'world', 'talks', 'family', 'discusses', 'private', 'life', 'well', 'within', 'typical', 'standup', 'topics', 'youll', 'get', 'plenty', 'angry', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'inches', 'away', 'purely', 'anarchic', 'louis', 'ck', 'newage', 'george', 'carlin', 'one', 'uses', 'exaggeratory', 'words', 'phrases', 'statements', 'make', 'afraid', 'abundance', 'strong', 'words', 'help', 'deliver', 'message', 'beauty', 'hilarious', 'step', 'given', 'point', 'movie', 'never', 'truly', 'feel', 'lost', 'stage', 'simple', 'camera', 'work', 'simple', 'louis', 'ck', 'running', 'show', 'absorbing', 'attention', 'even', 'wardrobe', 'extremely', 'simple', 'tshirt', 'jeans', 'adds', 'looks', 'like', 'simple', 'middleaged', 'man', 'spark', 'interesting', 'topics', 'throw', 'toilet', 'humor', 'case', 'get', 'bored', 'louis', 'cks', 'best', 'comedy', 'mainly', 'solely', 'comes', 'standup', 'opposed', 'extracurricular', 'activitiesjust', 'like', 'kevin', 'hart', 'hilarious', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'works', 'never', 'veers', 'away', 'stage', 'pessimistic', 'crude', 'rude', 'exaggerated', 'quietly', 'outofcontrol', 'works', 'every', 'possible', 'level', 'ultimate', 'joke', 'louis', 'ck', 'intelligent', 'man', 'never', 'pass', 'persona', 'choice', 'words', 'uncaring', 'attitude', 'show', 'nowhere', 'near', 'decent', 'cant', 'argue', 'stage', 'presence', 'least', 'among', 'best', 'business']"
1315,1421373,"Louis C.K.'s latest comedy concert film is Hilarious, the first ever stand-up documentary to be accepted at Sundance. The film is economically produced--C.K. does his own direction and editing--and spends much of its time in a mid shot of C.K.'s face; content is everything here.Whatever its personal implications, C.K.'s recent divorce is a great development for his comedy: it allows him to take his trademark pessimism on dates, to the gym, and even to the club. He pares incredulous contempt for beautiful people with his own healthy self-loathing--but because this is Louis C.K, he absolutely never pities himself. In fact, many of his best barbs are aimed at the entitled and ungrateful among us: among other great jabs, this film contains his now-famous ""chair in the sky"" airplane routine.Much of his best and most human material is derived from life as a father; he invokes his daughters with a disarming love and respect, while realistically explicating the more disgusting elements of parenthood. This too benefits from his recent divorce, as it serves to alienate him even further from contemporary dating.There is also a fair number of shock laughs, of course--at one point C.K tellingly acknowledges that upsetting people makes him laugh. And that in itself is the great appeal of Louis C.K.'s comedy, that we can bond over the idea that nothing good will ever happen to anyone and then find humor in it. Hilarious is all about finding laughs in pessimism, and it demonstrates what a hilarious performer C.K. is. -TK 9/22/10",0,,ur19643323,22 September 2010,0,,137,113,6.510948905109489,0.8248175182481752,"('cks', 4)('louis', 3)('comedy', 3)('film', 3)('hilarious', 3)('great', 3)('ck', 3)('ever', 2)('recent', 2)('divorce', 2)","['louis', 'cks', 'latest', 'comedy', 'concert', 'film', 'hilarious', 'first', 'ever', 'standup', 'documentary', 'accepted', 'sundance', 'film', 'economically', 'producedck', 'direction', 'editingand', 'spends', 'much', 'time', 'mid', 'shot', 'cks', 'face', 'content', 'everything', 'herewhatever', 'personal', 'implications', 'cks', 'recent', 'divorce', 'great', 'development', 'comedy', 'allows', 'take', 'trademark', 'pessimism', 'dates', 'gym', 'even', 'club', 'pares', 'incredulous', 'contempt', 'beautiful', 'people', 'healthy', 'selfloathingbut', 'louis', 'ck', 'absolutely', 'never', 'pities', 'fact', 'many', 'best', 'barbs', 'aimed', 'entitled', 'ungrateful', 'among', 'us', 'among', 'great', 'jabs', 'film', 'contains', 'nowfamous', 'chair', 'sky', 'airplane', 'routinemuch', 'best', 'human', 'material', 'derived', 'life', 'father', 'invokes', 'daughters', 'disarming', 'love', 'respect', 'realistically', 'explicating', 'disgusting', 'elements', 'parenthood', 'benefits', 'recent', 'divorce', 'serves', 'alienate', 'even', 'contemporary', 'datingthere', 'also', 'fair', 'number', 'shock', 'laughs', 'courseat', 'one', 'point', 'ck', 'tellingly', 'acknowledges', 'upsetting', 'people', 'makes', 'laugh', 'great', 'appeal', 'louis', 'cks', 'comedy', 'bond', 'idea', 'nothing', 'good', 'ever', 'happen', 'anyone', 'find', 'humor', 'hilarious', 'finding', 'laughs', 'pessimism', 'demonstrates', 'hilarious', 'performer', 'ck', 'tk']"

1318,6649108,"This is the first of the Netflix specials that were widely hyped due to it being his 'return'. I've never quite seen him as brilliant as others, so I decided to let all the hype and fuss pass before watching in a few weeks. This first special was actually a year or so ago when it was recorded, and some of the references are dated – an issue for some, but they still worked without being up to the minute fresh. The crowd are good, and Chappelle does seem to enjoy being on stage – and his charisma and timing is evident throughout, and I did laugh quite a lot.That said, some of his material gave me pause. I know he is a comedian and not a politician, but even with that 'pass' he did seem quite relaxed about his jokes about homosexual stereotypes, and transgender people; when he does African-American jokes it sort of feels more 'okay' simply because he is doing it from within rather than pointing at others. With this material it was not cruel, and it did have an opinion behind it, but it didn't totally sit with me. Likewise, his apparent attack on mandatory vaccinations came out of nowhere. These and a few others made me wonder why I was mostly okay with Chappelle doing this, but with someone else I would not be.Some of his other material is a bit broad too. Some of it doesn't really fly as a narrative, but then you have others which rely too much on crudity – crudity with wit works when he does it (as he mostly does), but somethings there seems to be less below the surface.

1325,6649108,"Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, children of all ages, grandmothers and grandfathers, Dave Cha-Pezzy is back, the one and only Dave Chappelle is back!Dave Chappelle (Half – Baked, The Chappelle Show) the comedy icon, makes his long awaited return to the screen and to the stage. Dave Chappelle now has a Netflix Original stand-up comedy special. With new, mature, raunchy, contemptuous, and always compelling comedy material. Now if you are coming into this thinking you're getting that Chappelle that says, ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"" Or him as Lil John, Prince, and as everyone's favorite crackhead Tyrone Biggums, you are not getting that. What you have here is a more mature Chappelle that has grown, and discusses more of his daily life. That's right Dave Chappelle grew up. He discusses politics, sex, scandals, race issues, kids, the education system, marriage, and all that good stuff. The stand-up special is actually two parts. The first part is titled, The Age of Spin Live at The Hollywood Palladium. The second part is titled, Deep in the Heart of Texas: Dave Chappelle Live at Austin City Limits. Fans online have been debating which special is better. I believe they are both well done. However, I do believe the first special is better. I personally enjoyed The Age of Spin Live at The Hollywood Palladium more for a variety of reasons. It really does feel like he is talking to the audience, he hasn't performed in L.A. in 10 years, it is more mature, it's funny, and you truly do feel like he is happy to be back, and happy to have grown as a comedian.That doesn't mean it is a perfect stand-up special, because in my opinion it is not. One of the biggest issues I have is the topics of current events.I wish there were more recent news topics Chappelle discussed in his special. For example, he could have made jokes and or statements about Trump, Obama leaving office, movies, trends, television shows (like when he played Negan from Walking Dead on Saturday Night Live), social media, and the entertainment industry then vs. now. Talking about Bill Cosby and O.J. Simpson now feels just a little dated. Even though the jokes are funny, just more fresher topics could have been used. I appreciate him taking a serious topic and adding a light hearted and funny message behind it though. The first special ishow can I put this? Stupid funny. He tells a joke about every time he has met O.J. and each one of them is hilarious, but really stupid. For instance, this isn't a spoiler, but it involves Chappelle and O.J.'s wife. Chappelle reenacts when he met O.J.'s wife and he says, ""Woman, are you trying' to get us both killed?"" Furthermore, he literally opens the show telling the crowd, ""You all better be a tough crowd, I'm going to say some stuff, so don't get mad."" So if you are someone who is easily offended this is NOT for you. On the other hand, if you are someone who has thick skin and can take race jokes, sex jokes, and profanity the by all means 'njoy.What I mainly enjoyed about the 2nd half is Chappelle discussing more of his private life. For example, his young son getting into a fight with girl. Chappelle mentions how he took a bite out of his son's school lunch, and then put it back in the bag so his son wouldn't notice. His son thought it was a girl in the class, and it ended up with his son slapping a little girl. This isn't the first father dilemma Chappelle discusses. Also, Chappelle discusses his marriage. He has been married since 2001, and he talks about/makes jokes about long marriages and relationships. I was cracking up laughing, when he mentions when his wife leaves the house he likes to get naked, jerk off and eat cereal in the living room. That's what I mean when I say you are getting more of the old Chappelle on this second half of the stand-up special. In my opinion, this half had too many sex jokes and gay jokes. It started out funny, but then I was ready for him to move onto the next topic. Overall, these are my final thoughts on Dave Chappelle's stand-up Netflix Special. Netflix announced these aren't the only two specials we are getting. There are more coming on the way towards the end of the year, and I say bring it on. Chappelle is more than Rick James, bitch. He is funny, has improved, has matured, he is a comedy king, and like Comedy Central has stated, I do believe he is one of the greatest comedians of all time. I believe this earns an8 out of 10!Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)Now if you'll excuse me, much like Dave Chappelle, I need to get my bowl of cereal ready and head on into the living room.

1326,6649108,"I really really wanted to like this. I am a huge fan of his older stand up specials, and The Chappelle Show. To me, it seemed like he was barely even interested in trying to be funny. I got the impression that his motivation for doing this show was political, and just made a half hearted attempt to put a funny twist on things to satisfy distributors/producers.As for the politics he was preaching, it was pretty meh, and not really original or insightful. Typical messages that I've heard others parrot a million times. The show is only interesting in the sense that it shows how quickly and significantly an adults personality can change if thrown into a certain environment. It seems that Dave can't handle fame and publicity too well. And come to think of it, I seem to recall Chappelle admitting this after he ended the Chappelle Show. Which adds to my suspicion that he got back into stand up comedy for reasons other than comedy, since he admitted that he ran out of ideas after season 2 of the Chappelle Show.",0,,ur24499415,12 July 2017,0,,91,77,6.285714285714286,0.8461538461538461,"('show', 5)('chappelle', 4)('really', 3)('like', 2)('stand', 2)('funny', 2)('got', 2)('comedy', 2)('wanted', 1)('huge', 1)","['really', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'huge', 'fan', 'older', 'stand', 'specials', 'chappelle', 'show', 'seemed', 'like', 'barely', 'even', 'interested', 'trying', 'funny', 'got', 'impression', 'motivation', 'show', 'political', 'made', 'half', 'hearted', 'attempt', 'put', 'funny', 'twist', 'things', 'satisfy', 'distributorsproducersas', 'politics', 'preaching', 'pretty', 'meh', 'really', 'original', 'insightful', 'typical', 'messages', 'ive', 'heard', 'others', 'parrot', 'million', 'times', 'show', 'interesting', 'sense', 'shows', 'quickly', 'significantly', 'adults', 'personality', 'change', 'thrown', 'certain', 'environment', 'seems', 'dave', 'cant', 'handle', 'fame', 'publicity', 'well', 'come', 'think', 'seem', 'recall', 'chappelle', 'admitting', 'ended', 'chappelle', 'show', 'adds', 'suspicion', 'got', 'back', 'stand', 'comedy', 'reasons', 'comedy', 'since', 'admitted', 'ran', 'ideas', 'season', 'chappelle', 'show']"

1328,6649108,"I'm giving this special a 9, not a 10, because I'm leaving Dave room to improve. I honestly can't find flaw with this performance, but watching it made me feel like there's still more to come, and it will be even better. If I give this a 10 and he puts out a better set, what then? Of the two Netflix sets out so far (this and 'Age of Spin'), I liked this one slightly more, but the difference isn't much. They're both really good.Without spoiling anything, what you get here is a new Dave Chappelle that retains all the qualities of the old one. His comedy is very much still 'Chappelle' material, whatever that means, but with longer sets he has a chance to make a few statements and show his intelligence as well. Don't worry, though, he doesn't sacrifice laughs to make points or badger you with political views. He simply mixes it up a bit more, uses his time wisely and capitalizes on the opportunity to deliver a much more intimate set than anything he's produced before now.It's Dave Chappelle as good as ever, back with new material.

Mostly this is what I got here as Rock covers topics such as marriage, parenthood, rap music and so on. The audience seemed more engaged than I was but I was still laughing along in an amused rather than ""in hysterics"" way. I think the reason for this is perhaps that Rock is really good with an audience and plays off them with great energy and timing - some of that does come across on the screen but not to the extent that I'm sure it is up close and personal.This helps him anyway because it can only be a good thing for a performer for your weaker moments to be met by frantic laughter, nodding and knee-slapping. Or at least that is how it works here because some of his material is not as smart or as based in realism as I would have liked, even if the majority of it is pretty sharp. Perhaps understandably he doesn't get into challenging the things he is joking about and as a result the viewer can ignore the shoe whether it fits or not. This does detract a little from his ""importance"" as a comedian but not his ability to get a laugh.Never Scared is pretty funny even if I never found it hilarious. The broad caricatures and gags are mostly based in reality to make for a satisfying comedy but some viewers will lose the good in the fact that it is very crude and sexually graphic in the content. To others this will be part of the appeal and this is often the way of things, but the show itself is just about good enough to appeal to the casual viewer as well as fans of Rock and this style of comedy.",0,,ur1002035,13 July 2008,0,,148,127,5.97972972972973,0.8581081081081081,"('rock', 4)('good', 4)('never', 2)('energy', 2)('funny', 2)('mostly', 2)('audience', 2)('way', 2)('perhaps', 2)('based', 2)","['never', 'totally', 'sold', 'chris', 'rock', 'tend', 'like', 'angry', 'outrageous', 'comedians', 'times', 'decided', 'check', 'special', 'looking', 'always', 'lots', 'energy', 'strong', 'language', 'used', 'context', 'funny', 'insightful', 'routine', 'mostly', 'got', 'rock', 'covers', 'topics', 'marriage', 'parenthood', 'rap', 'music', 'audience', 'seemed', 'engaged', 'still', 'laughing', 'along', 'amused', 'rather', 'hysterics', 'way', 'think', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'rock', 'really', 'good', 'audience', 'plays', 'great', 'energy', 'timing', 'come', 'across', 'screen', 'extent', 'im', 'sure', 'close', 'personalthis', 'helps', 'anyway', 'good', 'thing', 'performer', 'weaker', 'moments', 'met', 'frantic', 'laughter', 'nodding', 'kneeslapping', 'least', 'works', 'material', 'smart', 'based', 'realism', 'would', 'liked', 'even', 'majority', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'perhaps', 'understandably', 'doesnt', 'get', 'challenging', 'things', 'joking', 'result', 'viewer', 'ignore', 'shoe', 'whether', 'fits', 'detract', 'little', 'importance', 'comedian', 'ability', 'get', 'laughnever', 'scared', 'pretty', 'funny', 'even', 'never', 'found', 'hilarious', 'broad', 'caricatures', 'gags', 'mostly', 'based', 'reality', 'make', 'satisfying', 'comedy', 'viewers', 'lose', 'good', 'fact', 'crude', 'sexually', 'graphic', 'content', 'others', 'part', 'appeal', 'often', 'way', 'things', 'show', 'good', 'enough', 'appeal', 'casual', 'viewer', 'well', 'fans', 'rock', 'style', 'comedy']"

If only some bits wouldn't drag in so many parts to little laughs as opposed to bigger ones....this being said, after seeing it more times on HBO (it pops up a lot depending on the time you might be up at night), some of the lines work much funnier, especially the part about defending rap music and what it's like when one couple meets the ""perfect"" couple.

Rock, as demonstrated by his uneven movies, doesn't quite dominate any other medium like he does stand-up, and if anything it's great to see him at it again after a 4 year layoff. The material is somewhat more serious (abortion, gay marriage, the war in Iraq and a pointed defense of affirmative action are amongst the topics), and some of the lighter stuff has been covered in past shows (relationships, to name one) but to hear Rock's patented gravelly voice/shouted delivery is sweet music to the comedy ears. He rants better than anyone in the entertainment industry, and his frequent swears are anthemic when they would be perceived as simply overkill from anyone else. Rock is not quite as over-the-top as in past performances. At a few instances his exasperation seems a little forced, but throughout the show it's relatively unnoticeable. I won't ruin any one-liners, but there were a few classics.

Fresh off of several personal tragedies, she performed an impossible set that will likely live immortally at that venue. With a couple of documentaries about her struggles growing her name, this special had a good deal riding on it for her. I can't imagine she will have a hard go of it getting stage time at any US club, but this is a test to many for their tolerance of her subtle and measured style. Many portions are brilliant and understated. There are few moments gut- busting but a wealth of genuinely funny material. Thoughtful is underrated with comedy audiences, but inherently effective. You will remember a good deal more from this set than cheap quips from others. There are fewer words per minute than almost any set I've ever seen, timing is pushed to the limit.

Telling fat people it's their own fault they're fat is not insulting, it's just a fact. They won't like to hear it but it's just the truth. Why I loved Science and Animals more than Politics and Fame is because in those ones Ricky Gervais makes fun of religion. He shows how ridicule religion sounds by using true examples of the bible or whatever, and that in a very funny way. Mocking religion, it's one of my favorite things to do in daily life, so watching one of the best stand-up comedians doing it, thinking the same as I do, makes me just have a smile on my face. Science is one of his best shows and I honestly can't wait for the day that Ricky Gervais will make a show just called Religion. That's the only way to top every other show he did.

1393,1815899,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Almost exactly a year to the DVD release, I had to see Science, Gervais's latest live show, in what I think was one of the test shows before he polished it up and took it nationwide. All the material in this DVD release was exactly the same as I remembered it, so it looks like he pretty much had it sorted when I went to see him.The title, as it would imply, revolves around the concept of 'Science' which, Ricky tells us, can be used to find the cure for deadly diseases or create something like the atom bomb. But Gervais, with his trademark cutting humour, informs us that in fact this was a perfect example of science going right. Like the other three releases before this, it pretty much veers off this theme for a lot of the show, but the humour is still fairly consistent in it's style and delivery through out.By a fourth instalment, you may think the format may have lost it's edge a bit and it all may be sagging, but it seems as if Gervais was cutting his teeth with his first three stand up efforts and building it all up to his most accomplished effort, which he has with this more polished and slick show, which just comes off altogether as his most watchable and fulfilling entry. Certainly not for those easily offended or who just can't stand him, but what you've been waiting for for everyone else. ****",0,,ur0345596,18 April 2011,0,,130,104,5.769230769230769,0.8,"('night', 3)('science', 3)('show', 3)('like', 3)('may', 3)('friday', 2)('morning', 2)('exactly', 2)('dvd', 2)('release', 2)","['star', 'rating', 'saturday', 'night', 'friday', 'night', 'friday', 'morning', 'sunday', 'night', 'monday', 'morning', 'almost', 'exactly', 'year', 'dvd', 'release', 'see', 'science', 'gervaiss', 'latest', 'live', 'show', 'think', 'one', 'test', 'shows', 'polished', 'took', 'nationwide', 'material', 'dvd', 'release', 'exactly', 'remembered', 'looks', 'like', 'pretty', 'much', 'sorted', 'went', 'see', 'himthe', 'title', 'would', 'imply', 'revolves', 'around', 'concept', 'science', 'ricky', 'tells', 'us', 'used', 'find', 'cure', 'deadly', 'diseases', 'create', 'something', 'like', 'atom', 'bomb', 'gervais', 'trademark', 'cutting', 'humour', 'informs', 'us', 'fact', 'perfect', 'example', 'science', 'going', 'right', 'like', 'three', 'releases', 'pretty', 'much', 'veers', 'theme', 'lot', 'show', 'humour', 'still', 'fairly', 'consistent', 'style', 'delivery', 'outby', 'fourth', 'instalment', 'may', 'think', 'format', 'may', 'lost', 'edge', 'bit', 'may', 'sagging', 'seems', 'gervais', 'cutting', 'teeth', 'first', 'three', 'stand', 'efforts', 'building', 'accomplished', 'effort', 'polished', 'slick', 'show', 'comes', 'altogether', 'watchable', 'fulfilling', 'entry', 'certainly', 'easily', 'offended', 'cant', 'stand', 'youve', 'waiting', 'everyone', 'else']"
1394,1815899,"Gervais is possibly the best stand-up comedian I have ever seen. His take on fat people is side-splittingly funny, and his hilarious deconstruction of the Bible would have made Mark Twain proud.But this review isn't intended to glorify the obvious brilliance of Ricky's comedy. It's about how true his self-professed devotion to science truly is (given that he proudly labels himself a ""liberal"") – and just how much of an atheist he really is; I shall look into that too.Science needs to be embraced in all its beauty and ugliness. What liberals do (just like the Christian Right) is to pick and choose the science facts that suit them, while discarding and conveniently ignoring all scientific data that points towards truths that they consider unacceptable because they batter their fanciful, idealistic notions of humankind and society. Marxism (in which much of U.S. liberalism is deeply rooted), after all, clashes head-on with science on a number of issues, contradicting even entire fields of sciences in its very essence. Being both a Marxist and a Darwinist is like being ""a religious atheist"": mutually exclusive, totally impossible. Darwin believed in nature shaping us, not us shaping nature (and ourselves). Left-wingers have the arrogance and the foolishness to insist that man can re-shape both society and his world in a way that suits him, fairly swiftly even, rather than accept the ugly truth that nature sets very clear limits on what can and what cannot be altered or achieved by mere fallible mortals. Liberals, like Marxists, ignore the big picture science has to offer.Liberals use science usually when they can batter religious belief with it, and that's only because religious institutions are the arch-enemy (apart from Capitalism) of the Left. To any careful observer Marxism in itself represents a new religion, the only difference being that its followers detest that label: Utopia replaces Heaven, there is the belief in achieving total (social) equality all across the board just as Christians preach, there is the fanatical obsession with the poor rising up and ruling the world i.e. the uprising of the proletariat being an obvious rip-off of ""the meek shall inherit the Earth"" premise, etc. This is nothing new; Bertrand Russell had pointed out to the stark parallels between the two opposing(?) ideologies over half-a-century ago. More unites Marxism and Christianity than separates them. Karl Marx is treated a sort of Messiah, if not God himself; nothing he ever wrote is seriously questioned by his followers (as with any other imaginary (religious) god), and ""Das Kapital"" becomes in a very real sense the replacement for the Bible, a book so ""perfect"" that it prevents all criticism amongst its rabid followers. Marxism and its naïve dabbling in PERFECTION: not particularly scientific.So when Ricky says that he believes in science, this is only partly true. He misuses science just as many others had done. When faced with a rock-hard scientific study that goes against any of his foolish and naïve liberal beliefs, Ricky, like any other idealist, simply ignores it, labeling hence dismissing it off-hand as ""sexist"", ""fascist"" or whatever other terms of blame-and-shame liberals like to throw around on an almost daily basis against their political opponents, whether deserved or not. For example, offer Gervais the plethora of scientific studies that show that men are more apt in logic and mathematics while women are more gifted in multi-tasking and languages, and Ricky might likely dispute this – without even studying the facts. ""Sexist!"" Liberals simply ignore anything and everything that gnaws at their shaky belief that everyone everywhere in this vast world is totally equal in every way. They often ignore the obvious, whenever it is ""ugly"".There is no equality in nature, and certainly no equality to be observed in any group of advanced primates, and yet they so dogmatically insist in total equality among men? This is idealism taken to its extreme, bordering on blind, stark-raving-mad zeal. (In that sense a liberal behaves exactly like a fundamentalist foam-at-the-mouth preacher.) The fanciful belief that equality reigns and/or should reign supreme all across the board (whether it pertains to gender, race, religion, class, etc) is the culmination of the gullibility of their flawed thinking. They have succeeded in rendering many studies in the field of genetics as so taboo that they can't even be funded. So how does that fit in with the liberals' claim that they promote freedom of thought and science? This line of ""reasoning"" very much suggests that humans are ""the Chosen Ones"", somehow picked at random in this unconscious universe, yet somehow destined to achieve equality that normally only exists in fairy tales. Irrational, over-optimistic idealism is found in equal amounts in religions and Socialism; both are equally guilty of dismissing truths (i.e. science) in favour of whatever hallucinogenic scenario their wishful thinking imposes on them. Hence why most atheists are nothing but closet Marxists, hence not true atheists, only wannabe atheists.The plain/sad truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people cannot stand to face reality and all of its harsh indifference. I would submit that around nearly all people suffer from this ""cosmic insecurity"" – essentially a result of our mortality hence inability to cope with the idea of death; this bludgeons our powers of reasoning. Nothing destroys logic and common sense like fear - precisely why nearly everyone needs a crutch in life, i.e. opts for one or the other: either religion or Marxism (or at least liberalism). These provide security blankets to the unstable, fearful and confused human mind, offering the unrealistic/absurd promise of eventual bliss and some kind of childish Robin-Hoodian equality.In other words, Gervais isn't nearly the level-headed grounded-in-reality science-worshiping intellectual that he fancies himself as. I want to ask him about organic food, genetically-modified crops: another area in which the Left behave like panicky doom-bringers, basing their opposition to this revolutionary area of science on nothing but anti-scientific emotionalism.",0,,ur7059410,29 February 2012,0,,552,424,6.802536231884058,0.7681159420289855,"('science', 10)('like', 8)('equality', 6)('liberals', 5)('marxism',

1403,3918650,"Destined to be the underrated comedy event of the 2014 year is Bill Maher: Live from D.C., an uproariously funny live-taping of Maher performing a comedy special at the luxurious Warner Theater on 13th Street just minutes after recording an episode of Real Time With Bill Maher at the HBO theater. In under ten minutes, Maher races out of the HBO studios, heads to his dressing room, changes into casual garb, races outside into his Motorcade, equipped with six police motorcycles escorting him to the Warner Theater, before sprinting the last three blocks and onto the stage of the venue. All of this was announced in a fun and unexpected manner by sportscaster Keith Olbermann and documentarian Michael Moore, who sat in a balcony at the Warner Theater.Despite noting his mental exhaustion with his hectic day of planning and live taping during the live episode of Real Time, Maher is a zealous comedic force on stage, as if he just woke up, refreshed and giddy to perform live. We don't see a tired, weary Maher, but the Maher we've known for years - the person who waltzes on stage and give us his unbridled, brutally honest opinion on politics, not caring whether or not we accept it as truth or agree with it. He's simply happy to get it out there in a blunt and often vulgar manner, but despite such choices in vocabulary and delivery, always comes off as either insightful or at least eloquent.With Live from D.C., after his incredible entry, he goes on to give his politically-charged, bleeding-heart secularist/liberal rants on American politics, the idiocy of the Tea Party, the more qualified but admittedly flawed Liberals/Democrats, recent controversies plaguing the country, and comment on recent things in his personal life, such as his hysterical response to the ""feud"" between him and Donald Trump that arose from a senseless and illegitimate bet. Maher remarks about how Republicans ignore that other presidents, even Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, took numerous executive orders when they were running the country, but treat Obama as if he was ""Dracula crossed with Hitler with lung cancer."" In addition, Maher comments on working with Congress and in American politics with the thesis of it coming down to ""being patient with stupid white people,"" as well as stating that, when it comes down to it, the common American feels that the United States should continue to ""bomb Arabs, pay farmers not to grow corn, and name buildings after Ronald Reagan."" Maher is even greeted with a plethora of positive and negative hecklers, to which he finally tires of and states, ""stop yelling out; I'm sure what I have is better."" He continues to amuse them every now and then, even challenging a woman to support her shouted-statement right then and there, keenly reminding us of that special episode of Real Time when 9/11 ""truthers"" found ways to interrupt the live taping of the program. Yet Maher is never phased by such immaturity and lack of respect and attention; he is far too busy ranting, raving, and cracking joke-after-joke about the country he loves to reside in and criticize so deeply.Live from D.C. comes directly after Maher concluded his year-long ""Flip a District"" campaign, an online campaign to get people to oust somebody from the American Congress they find harmful and detrimental to the American political system. That candidate turned out to be John Kline (HR, R-MN), who Maher will be targeting to rid Minnesota of this coming November with the midterm elections. Even as the effectiveness of this campaign comes into question, one cannot fault Maher for his dedication in not only voicing his opinion, but donating to the political campaign of Barack Obama and actually making a commendable effort to try and get a start on fixing what is happening to American politics. It's a noble fight to a questionable reward, but at least it provides for some spectacular comedic value in the meantime.Directed by: Troy Miller.",0,,ur23483288,12 September 2014,0,,363,288,6.451790633608815,0.7933884297520661,"('maher', 14)('live', 6)('american', 6)('politics', 4)('comes', 4)('even', 4)('campaign', 4)('dc', 3)('warner', 3)('theater', 3)","['destined', 'underrated', 'comedy', 'event', 'year', 'bill', 'maher', 'live', 'dc', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'livetaping', 'maher', 'performing', 'comedy', 'special', 'luxurious', 'warner', 'theater', 'street', 'minutes', 'recording', 'episode', 'real', 'time', 'bill', 'maher', 'hbo', 'theater', 'ten', 'minutes', 'maher', 'races', 'hbo', 'studios', 'heads', 'dressing', 'room', 'changes', 'casual', 'garb', 'races', 'outside', 'motorcade', 'equipped', 'six', 'police', 'motorcycles', 'escorting', 'warner', 'theater', 'sprinting', 'last', 'three', 'blocks', 'onto', 'stage', 'venue', 'announced', 'fun', 'unexpected', 'manner', 'sportscaster', 'keith', 'olbermann', 'documentarian', 'michael', 'moore', 'sat', 'balcony', 'warner', 'theaterdespite', 'noting', 'mental', 'exhaustion', 'hectic', 'day', 'planning', 'live', 'taping', 'live', 'episode', 'real', 'time', 'maher', 'zealous', 'comedic', 'force', 'stage', 'woke', 'refreshed', 'giddy', 'perform', 'live', 'dont', 'see', 'tired', 'weary', 'maher', 'maher', 'weve', 'known', 'years', 'person', 'waltzes', 'stage', 'give', 'us', 'unbridled', 'brutally', 'honest', 'opinion', 'politics', 'caring', 'whether', 'accept', 'truth', 'agree', 'hes', 'simply', 'happy', 'get', 'blunt', 'often', 'vulgar', 'manner', 'despite', 'choices', 'vocabulary', 'delivery', 'always', 'comes', 'either', 'insightful', 'least', 'eloquentwith', 'live', 'dc', 'incredible', 'entry', 'goes', 'give', 'politicallycharged', 'bleedingheart', 'secularistliberal', 'rants', 'american', 'politics', 'idiocy', 'tea', 'party', 'qualified', 'admittedly', 'flawed', 'liberalsdemocrats', 'recent', 'controversies', 'plaguing', 'country', 'comment', 'recent', 'things', 'personal', 'life', 'hysterical', 'response', 'feud', 'donald', 'trump', 'arose', 'senseless', 'illegitimate', 'bet', 'maher', 'remarks', 'republicans', 'ignore', 'presidents', 'even', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'george', 'w', 'bush', 'took', 'numerous', 'executive', 'orders', 'running', 'country', 'treat', 'obama', 'dracula', 'crossed', 'hitler', 'lung', 'cancer', 'addition', 'maher', 'comments', 'working', 'congress', 'american', 'politics', 'thesis', 'coming', 'patient', 'stupid', 'white', 'people', 'well', 'stating', 'comes', 'common', 'american', 'feels', 'united', 'states', 'continue', 'bomb', 'arabs', 'pay', 'farmers', 'grow', 'corn', 'name', 'buildings', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'maher', 'even', 'greeted', 'plethora', 'positive', 'negative', 'hecklers', 'finally', 'tires', 'states', 'stop', 'yelling', 'im', 'sure', 'better', 'continues', 'amuse', 'every', 'even', 'challenging', 'woman', 'support', 'shoutedstatement', 'right', 'keenly', 'reminding', 'us', 'special', 'episode', 'real', 'time', 'truthers', 'found', 'ways', 'interrupt', 'live', 'taping', 'program', 'yet', 'maher', 'never', 'phased', 'immaturity', 'lack', 'respect', 'attention', 'far', 'busy', 'ranting', 'raving', 'cracking', 'jokeafterjoke', 'country', 'loves', 'reside', 'criticize', 'deeplylive', 'dc', 'comes', 'directly', 'maher', 'concluded', 'yearlong', 'flip', 'district', 'campaign', 'online', 'campaign', 'get', 'people', 'oust', 'somebody', 'american', 'congress', 'find', 'harmful', 'detrimental', 'american', 'political', 'system', 'candidate', 'turned', 'john', 'kline', 'hr', 'rmn', 'maher', 'targeting', 'rid', 'minnesota', 'coming', 'november', 'midterm', 'elections', 'even', 'effectiveness', 'campaign', 'comes', 'question', 'one', 'cannot', 'fault', 'maher', 'dedication', 'voicing', 'opinion', 'donating', 'political', 'campaign', 'barack', 'obama', 'actually', 'making', 'commendable', 'effort', 'try', 'get', 'start', 'fixing', 'happening', 'american', 'politics', 'noble', 'fight', 'questionable', 'reward', 'least', 'provides', 'spectacular', 'comedic', 'value', 'meantimedirected', 'troy', 'miller']"

1407,8398704,"Bill, because I have a tremendous amount of admiration, respect, and love for you, I offer this critique in a style I'm positive you'll appreciate.New Rule: ""If your comedy blows, stick to the talk shows."" Very similar to your saying: ""Don't be funny, guard the money."" You said this to an unruly political guest who deserved it. As I recall, his bomb was a comedic attempt while insulting another guest. He fully deserved the negative reactions as well. But good advice goes both ways so, I'm glad to help. New Rule: ""We get it . . . more or less"" You don't have to explain your references. When you use a good reference and we're laughing, ride the wave. No further explanation is required. Otherwise it's like a form of reverse-heckling. Or, like watching the narrated version of Bladerunner at the peak of a beautifully crafted scene, to have it destroyed by a voice-over. (That's a reference by the way).New Rule: ""Truth in advertising."" For example, any of your guests, the politicians, scientists, doctors, not in the entertainment industry, don't have to be entertaining. However, I have every expectation for you to be. If you want to stick to your rant on a singular topic or do an impromptu roast on someone in absentia, then say so upfront. Wait! I may be wrong. The title does say Live from Oklahoma, not Live Comedy from Oklahoma. Sorry, please feel free to disregard this one.New Rule: ""Read the room."" Actually this is an old rule. For, every good comedian knows when to pivot to the funny stuff. If you don't remember how, just watch some of your past show's political guests as they try ""not"" to answer a question. With all those writers, couldn't you spare one to help with some alternate jokes? I haven't seen someone bomb this bad since your gal-pal Ann Coulter on the Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. (That's ref number two).New Rule: ""Network."" I'm sure there's an excellent support system for you, so use it. For example, do the LA Show-biz lunch thing with Dennis Miller and Eddie Murphy. They too used to be funny. However, they don't come off looking like a douche. Perhaps they can give you some tips. Bill, you have one of the most topical and important shows on TV with Real Time. Even when comparing to Jon Stewart and your immediate neighbor, John Oliver. You have an eclectic and stellar collection of guests such as, Seth MacFarlane, Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and one of my favorites, the late Werner Klemperer (Colonel Wilhelm Klink) who had several appearances on Politically Incorrect, and even guest hosted like Seth did. But unlike Jon and John, your talk/news show skills didn't translate to a solo performance. Are you just better with guests that effectively punctuate your run-on rants?

I was little apprehensive about the gimmicky use of 3 microphones, but in the end, everything falls into place.What is similar with a Dave Chappelle stand up is the thoughtfulness, the introspection, the meditation. Now to look at three acts separately, at least a few one-liners are more like dad-jokes, the regular stand-up bits are mostly funny but not laugh-out-loud variety except the last bit which is very Amy Schumer-ish and brought nothing new to the table. What stands out is the meditation of the center mic, the non-rant version of everything that can be rant on, and the satire and the irony living a life that is partly felt and mostly numb. But Neal creates the vehicle that gives you a taste of his own life and reflected on it, a taste of your own life, partly felt, mostly numb.I rated it 10 on 10, although I do not think it will be counted as classic, but somehow this standup resonated with me, reminded me of Tig Notaro, Dave Chappelle among others.",0,,ur98153986,15 April 2020,0,1.0,113,94,6.345132743362832,0.831858407079646,"('dave', 3)('chappelle', 3)('standup', 3)('mostly', 3)('life', 3)('neal', 2)('hide', 2)('behind', 2)('amy', 2)('everything', 2)","['neal', 'brennan', 'could', 'hide', 'probably', 'hide', 'day', 'behind', 'familiar', 'behind', 'supremely', 'talented', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'toanextenttalented', 'amy', 'schumer', 'directions', 'lame', 'okay', 'none', 'exceptional', 'never', 'liked', 'standup', 'either', 'amd', 'one', 'changes', 'little', 'apprehensive', 'gimmicky', 'use', 'microphones', 'end', 'everything', 'falls', 'placewhat', 'similar', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'stand', 'thoughtfulness', 'introspection', 'meditation', 'look', 'three', 'acts', 'separately', 'least', 'oneliners', 'like', 'dadjokes', 'regular', 'standup', 'bits', 'mostly', 'funny', 'laughoutloud', 'variety', 'except', 'last', 'bit', 'amy', 'schumerish', 'brought', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'stands', 'meditation', 'center', 'mic', 'nonrant', 'version', 'everything', 'rant', 'satire', 'irony', 'living', 'life', 'partly', 'felt', 'mostly', 'numb', 'neal', 'creates', 'vehicle', 'gives', 'taste', 'life', 'reflected', 'taste', 'life', 'partly', 'felt', 'mostly', 'numbi', 'rated', 'although', 'think', 'counted', 'classic', 'somehow', 'standup', 'resonated', 'reminded', 'tig', 'notaro', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'among', 'others']"

1433,1190722,"Many comics react against anything 'politically correct' to get us to titter nervously and to push boundaries. We enjoy feeling like adults in a world already jaded with everyday shocking behavior. Unfortunately, the spirit and meaning behind Louis C.K.'s material in this show belie the ugly underside of his prejudiced opinions. What's shocking is how naked he is with it. He starts off calling for a revival of the word 'faggot'. He likes its pejorative use and cites examples. This discourse is a silly gambit for him to scream the word out over and over. ""Faggot! faggot! faggot!"" He goes on to say he does not mean to use it as a slur towards gay men. Well, guess what? That's what it is - a slur used towards gay men. And he affirmatively approves using the word toward annoying, effeminate men. Is this a fair distinction for a straight, white guy to make? To cap it off, he adds that every time a person performs fellatio it must take something out of that person. His assurance of respecting gay men is weak as he laughs and shouts a slur he admits he feels holds validity. No respect there. He does, however, respect the butterfly beauty he sees in female genitalia. Okay we get it, Louis CK. You're straight. You're also homophobic. Next in the shocking-word-as-funny-gambit tirade is the big one . . . the ""N"" word. Like overuse of the word 'faggot', it's like a South Park episode where he seems intent on using it over and over as if he gets points each time he does. He goes on to tell a story about how a white guy makes him coffee and he thinks of the guy as a 'nigger' (and a good one no less). The problem is - despite the coffee making guy's being white, he is in a position of servitude. The ""N"" word applies to both black people and people of servitude interchangeably. That's the problem with it! (One of many actually) Duh. It is offensive because people of color and people in service positions are not interchangeable. Not realizing this is at the heart of racism. Thinking of anyone as 'nigger' in your head, as Louis CK says he does, is an ugly thing. Not funny. I think Louis CK has over shared. I do not like what I see - which is too much of his intolerance, lack of empathy, and inability to fully reason out his act. At best he has exploited words and concepts, which are shocking and taboo for a reason, just to get a few cheap laughs.

I just find that most of the things people write are useless for almost anybody else in the world aside from themselves, self-serving exercises of opinion with no real consequence. With that being said I could not sit by silent after reading 'hawaiitude's' (respectfully) ridiculous and immature critique of Louis C.K.'s newest stand-up special 'Chewed Up.' First off, before I attack someone else's rightful opinion on the subject matter I will talk about the subject matter itself: Louis C.K. I have been a big fan of Louie's for a number of years now. I thought 'Shameless' was a terrific, brutally honest AND hilarious stand-up showcase. His follow-up 'Chewed Up,' trumps his last one by miles. It is a GREAT stand-up special so refreshingly real that, expectedly, there are folks out there that would callously toss it under the category of 'offensive,' and that the performer (to paraphrase) is 'leaving his prejudices naked for all to see.' When I hear phrases like this it turns my stomach. The idea of 'brutal honesty' has gotten so watered-down, so cavalierly tossed about when it doesn't apply (Carlos Mencia, Ron White,etc, etc) that when someone comes along and TRULY EXERCISES this idea people curl up into a ball and weep about the insensitivity of it. COMEDY DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SENSITIVITY, NOR RESPECT, NOT CULTURAL AWARENESS. If a comedian chooses to worry and IS funny, more power to them, I'll laugh. But it is by no means a requisite. No means.The people that complain about this stuff claim they are not PC but in truth hide their PC-ness under a thin veil. PC doesn't only mean hyphens in between ethnic descriptions, PC is also the idea that if people use a particular set of words (i.e. 'faggot,' 'nigger,' 'cunt') that they of course, have to be, prejudiced, racist, bigoted. That kind of close-mindedness and lack of insight is the very definition of political correctness. And 'Hawaiitude,' the whole comment about the white coffeshop worker being in a place of 'servitude' is such a pile of overanalytical garbage that it belongs nowhere near comedic assessment.Louis C.K. leaves himself naked for us, that I will agree with, but in a vulgarly heroic way that brings a set of comfort to people who aren't afraid of every little aspect of the human condition, because a lot of it is ugly, even in the most righteous, virtuous souls.I recommend 'Chewed Up' for anyone who wants to laugh at someone whose acerbic, subversive, SELF-deprecating, downright profane comedy leads you into places within your own psyche that you otherwise would be afraid to face, but is nonetheless there.

What he says about the sexual allegations was profound to me. Example being of him talking about how some prominent male actors wanted to help the women's causes but instead get ostracize because they themselves also did some sexual harassing/assaulting themselves in their younger days. Then he beautifully draws a parallel with what happened in South Africa's apartheid and how that situation got solved not by ostracizing everyone that contributed to the system but by making a safe space for everyone to confess to what they did(Full disclosure, I don't know if that's true or not. I just took Dave's word for it.) So pretty much saying that that's what women in Hollywood should do. They should make a safe space for men to confess their sins so that they can learn and move on. Then of course the allegory of the iceberg slim's book ""Pimp"" to why he left the Chappelle show was very profound. Personally I never knew Dave Chappelle was this intelligent. Don't get me wrong. I never thought the man was stupid. I just thought he was only a talented comedian. But he shows that he's a little bit more than that and that's why this is my favorite of his Netflix stand up.

In trying to tackle certain topical issues, some of Chappelle's material loses its sharpness and almost ends in serious social commentary territory, rather than comedy.

Hs commentary on guns and buying one, towards the end, is hilarious.Overall there are many glimpses of the Dave Chappelle we all know and love from his Chappelle Show days.

Dave aso sticks by his ""patented"" move of the walk-away, wherein he kind of drops a line and stalks off in faux fear or shame or I don't, but it's a nice trick where he embraces his joke/idea while seeming to flee it. after letting Netflix roll over to the epilogue, it then rolled over to a really early special of his, and he had that same move, and same sheepish over-the-shoulder grin saying ""that line was no mistake.""By the way, just an idea but if comedy, like a music program, has you smiling the whole time, maybe it's a bit too safe?Anyways I for one am glad he hasn't just said efff it all and walked (swam?) entirely away to an island with his family, duck-grease and all.

To be fair I can still acknowledge his talent. He has great delivery, timing, he knows how to work a crowd and can improvise if he has to. He is very good at his job and I'm not going to even try and deny that. The problem for me is his newer material. I can't relate to it the same way as I used to with his old stuff, but, honestly I don't even really like that anymore. There are some types criticising this for being offensive. I don't think that is fair. There were a few jokes I did not like, but, I'm not going to waste time complaining, I just didn't laugh at those. There are other people saying this show is edgy and brave. It isn't that either. He doesn't take any real risks in this, the world has just become so insanely politically correct so maybe it seems that way. What I will say is that I don't think he is trying as hard as he used to. His old work was quicker and there were more jokes. Now he will spend as much time doing over the top reactions to his own jokes as he will actually telling them. It gets kind of annoying.

1480,8101766,"Ray Romano returns to his comedic roots doing stand-up at the Comedy Cellar in New York City for this 2019 Netflix special. It's divided into two parts, with Ray doing separate sets, I believe on the same night to a different audience each time. He seemed a little tired in his delivery, bemoaning the fact that he's now over fifty (sixty three actually as I write this), although the insight and maturity gained from growing older gives him the ability to comment on aging and raising a family. A lot of his jokes are aimed at his now adult kids, with a few zingers thrown his wife's way. At times he does delve into risque subjects, but fortunately keeps his dialog relatively obscene free, though you may wince every now and then when he ventures into areas that could make you squeamish. Apparently his entire family which was in attendance didn't seem to mind, as they all joined him following his last set to go out for pizza. The only one who escaped the good natured wrath during his monologue was his one and only daughter, who he affectionately referred to as 'the good one'.

1498,8101766,"I like Ray. I was a causal watcher of his show and always appreciated the writing, characters and relatable humor. It was fun to watch these two sets filmed in NYC with no frills in a small room. This is where most comedy happens in the world, in small rooms with hardworking comics doing their thing working jokes, making choices, responding and being in the moment with a new crowd each set. The first set is solid and relatable, he goes a little too TMI for office/family viewing and drives home some big laughs on aging. The second set starts a little bumpy and finds its way into another skillful well-honed set but this feels more performance and spun than the first set, this time focusing more on family and marriage. It ends showing his family at nearby Joe's (Best Slice in NYC), which is a nice touch anchoring that he is just a man and relatable. However, it does contradict the vibe of authenticity when stories he told made the kids seem much younger and it is revealed the that they are much older. It gave me a weird vibe that the material wasn't current or that he was angling to make himself relevant to a younger audience and wanted to be their friend/peer rather than the looking great 60 year old he is today. The most authentic honest moments came during talk of aging because it is where he is now and the vulnerability of sharing the awkwardness of his HBO sex scene in Vinyl, a great drama that never found its audience where he stepped into a great character challenge. It was less interesting to hear him carry on about how horny he remains as if his virility was in question and he was trying to prove he is a 16 year old at heart tryin to win over the young bucks in the crowd.

1550,0422528,"Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic (2005)* (out of 4) Sarah Silverman's controversial comedy show features all sorts of jokes ranging from racist ones to jokes about the Holocaust, 9/11, AIDS and various other taboo subjects. I'm sure many would watch this thing or even just read about it and throw a fit over the subjects that are made fun of. Sure, not too many people would have the balls to make a joke about 9/11 or child rape but if you're going to do it then perhaps shouldn't you write good material? I personally wasn't offended by any of the jokes here but I must say that I found all of them to be poorly written. I think you can look at any great stand-up comedian, be it Pryor or even Lenny Bruce, and hope that they believe in what they are saying. No matter if it's tragic or comical I think it's important that they believe in what they are saying and that's clearly not the case here. If Silverman really believed in anything she's saying here then it would be shocking and funny. However, it's clear that she's just telling these jokes because she's trying to be outrageous and shocking and that to me isn't funny. I wasn't really digging her delivery style either but I think in the end this film fails because the material is just weak. The musical numbers are just as lame as are the opening and closing ""acted"" parts.

1552,0422528,"Sitting with her friends hearing about how good their careers and lives are going, Sarah Silverman boasts of her having a sell-out show that night. Making her excuses she rushes out to throw together a show at short notice with herself as the star.This film didn't make it to a full cinema release in the UK where I was and it is kinda obvious why because this is not the sort of thing you need to see in the cinema  this is a DVD at best. However, regardless of the media, I saw this on DVD and it fits the television best given that it is essentially a recorded stand-up show punctuated by clips and asides that range from a few seconds to a few minutes. These asides are generally OK and are worked into the stand-up for the DVD viewer but it is the stand-up where she does her best work. The downside of it being framed as a film is that we get some awkward and unfunny asides, including a weird ending to the film where really it should have gone out to the cheering of crowds.The stand-up material is mostly good though. Some dismiss Silverman as just trading on being sweet and sexy but yet saying racist and shocking things and at times that is true  but yet still quite funny. When she is at her best she manages to be shocking but in an imaginative and funny way, presenting it as innocent at the same time. You know she has nailed it when you go ""oooh"" and laugh at the same time and that happened to me several times during this film. Her style does rather suck the energy and flow out of her own material here though as she allows the ""shock"" to sit on the audience for a minute, rather than building on it. This is a shame because it makes the show feel like lots of independently funny lines rather than a great comedy show.The production of the film does a good job of filming Silverman but not of capturing the audience or the atmosphere of the show. The aside are mostly well done though even if they do feel like sketches from a TV show. Overall though Jesus is Magic is an enjoyable live show that will appeal to Silverman fans. I found it funny but not consistent enough and I'm not sure the ""film"" idea was a good one  it would have been better with a couple of show edited together, which would also have helped by removing the ""yeah, well, anyway"" moments that inject nervousness into the comedy in a way that limits build.",0,,ur1002035,5 February 2009,0,,210,159,5.695238095238095,0.7571428571428571,"('show', 8)('film', 6)('good', 4)('silverman', 4)('best', 4)('standup', 4)('though', 4)('funny', 4)('dvd', 3)('asides', 3)","['sitting', 'friends', 'hearing', 'good', 'careers', 'lives', 'going', 'sarah', 'silverman', 'boasts', 'sellout', 'show', 'night', 'making', 'excuses', 'rushes', 'throw', 'together', 'show', 'short', 'notice', 'starthis', 'film', 'didnt', 'make', 'full', 'cinema', 'release', 'uk', 'kinda', 'obvious', 'sort', 'thing', 'need', 'see', 'cinema', 'dvd', 'best', 'however', 'regardless', 'media', 'saw', 'dvd', 'fits', 'television', 'best', 'given', 'essentially', 'recorded', 'standup', 'show', 'punctuated', 'clips', 'asides', 'range', 'seconds', 'minutes', 'asides', 'generally', 'ok', 'worked', 'standup', 'dvd', 'viewer', 'standup', 'best', 'work', 'downside', 'framed', 'film', 'get', 'awkward', 'unfunny', 'asides', 'including', 'weird', 'ending', 'film', 'really', 'gone', 'cheering', 'crowdsthe', 'standup', 'material', 'mostly', 'good', 'though', 'dismiss', 'silverman', 'trading', 'sweet', 'sexy', 'yet', 'saying', 'racist', 'shocking', 'things', 'times', 'true', 'yet', 'still', 'quite', 'funny', 'best', 'manages', 'shocking', 'imaginative', 'funny', 'way', 'presenting', 'innocent', 'time', 'know', 'nailed', 'go', 'oooh', 'laugh', 'time', 'happened', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'style', 'rather', 'suck', 'energy', 'flow', 'material', 'though', 'allows', 'shock', 'sit', 'audience', 'minute', 'rather', 'building', 'shame', 'makes', 'show', 'feel', 'like', 'lots', 'independently', 'funny', 'lines', 'rather', 'great', 'comedy', 'showthe', 'production', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'filming', 'silverman', 'capturing', 'audience', 'atmosphere', 'show', 'aside', 'mostly', 'well', 'done', 'though', 'even', 'feel', 'like', 'sketches', 'tv', 'show', 'overall', 'though', 'jesus', 'magic', 'enjoyable', 'live', 'show', 'appeal', 'silverman', 'fans', 'found', 'funny', 'consistent', 'enough', 'im', 'sure', 'film', 'idea', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'better', 'couple', 'show', 'edited', 'together', 'would', 'also', 'helped', 'removing', 'yeah', 'well', 'anyway', 'moments', 'inject', 'nervousness', 'comedy', 'way', 'limits', 'build']"

She should stick to the seven year old lesbian jokes. 2 people found this helpful Edit Delete Comment Hildegard Friday 4.0 out of 5 starsFunny, but not sure how ""ironic"" she really is April 14, 2007 Format: DVD Miss Silverman is the most recent addition to the group of ""meta-bigot"" comedians -- i.e. comics who tell ethnic jokes supposedly for their ""shock"" value, while hiding behind a screen of supposed irony -- which includes Dave Chappelle, Carlos Mencia, Chris Rock, and the writers of South Park. I find it odd that she gets away with telling so many black jokes and throwing around the ""n"" word so much. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that she is attractive, female and Jewish. If Larry the Cable guy ever said the ""n"" word on a comedy DVD, I guarantee you that Al Sharpton would already be carrying his head around on the end of a stick.Keep in mind that Silverman has been dating Jimmy Kimmel of ""The Man Show"" fame for many years. Though I am a female, I did truly enjoy The Man Show, though I thought it wasn't as ironic as many people would have you believe. Anti-PC ""irony"" is really a protective screen for telling the kind of jokes most people only tell among themselves, and don't have the gonads to do so in public. Anyone who can appreciate humor knows there's a difference between comedy and hate, but many are so sensitive that they can't tell the difference. 3 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Declan Gallagher 4.0 out of 5 starsSilverman Is A Very Funny Comedienne, And This Is A Very Funny Movie, But It Is Too Tame When It Should Be Scathing December 11, 2005 Sarah Silverman is perhaps the funniest comedienne working today. She is quick, raunchy, profane, and sometimes racist, which is both good and bad. Her new concert film, ""Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic"" is almost as funny as she is. However Silverman seems to have toned it down for this movie. She is not as racist as she has been in the past (the closest she comes is a preachy monologue about how she had a joke with a derogatory term for race in it and thought it was ""edgy"" until people of that race were sitting in the front row of one of her shows.) She keeps the swearing to a bare minimum, and uses gross-out humor only in one quick joke. The humor of this movie is more...printable...we'll say. She still skewers AIDS (""When God gives you AIDS-and he does give you AIDS-you make lemonAIDS""), the Holocasust (""If Hitler knew that in sixty years the people he had based his genocide around would be driving German made cars, would he have changed his opinion? Killing customers just isn't good for business""), 9/11 (""Yes. The events on that day were tragic, unforgiveable, and unforgettable. It was the day I found out the soy chai latte I had been drinking everday had 900 calories""; ""People love things that come first. That's why American Airlines' slogan should be 'American Airlines: First through the towers'. Because they were first""), and, quite briefly, but hilariously, rape (I was raped by my doctor, which is sort of bittersweet for a Jewish girl."") That is where the problem lies in this otherwise near-flawless movie. The taboo subjects that made her famous and basically what she is are just barely touched upon in this movie. The single above mentioned joke is given about thirty seconds, plus at least a minute of the audience not knowing whether they should laugh or feel bad for her before Silverman moves onto talking about 9/11 and how she should buy all the Osama websites (""Then who's he gonna have to come to? Big S, that's who."") Another problem, the only other, with this movie is the sketch comedy bits at the beginning, end, and in the middle. The beginning one is sort of funny, but the end one is unforgivably bad. It almost seems the writers were aiming for how sad she really is instead of comedy. Silverman's humor is so adult-oriented and mature that it seems out of place to see her passionately kissing her mirror image. There are some great musical numbers, one of which has Silverman driving against a fake 1950's backdrop. Towards the end she does a great rendition of something called ""The Bong Song"" (which is less about bongs than Jewish people driving Mercedes'. I found out towards the end it was Silverman herself who wrote ""The Bong Song"" (at least I think that's what it was called, even though the word bong was mentioned only once) was written by Silverman, as where all the other songs except for her show-stopping rendition of 'Saving Grace' (the gross-out part of her act. Alas it last but two minutes). There is also a great song, sung via Silverman to her late grandmothers retirement center called ""You're Gonna Die Soon"". Silverman is very funny, and the movie shows she is, but it needed to be more daring and cringe-inducing. There are many funny moments here, but there could have been more. The end credits are very funny, as is the scene at the very end. There is also a very funny moment where Silverman says that being a stripper is a gateway into the pornography industry, and a woman in the audience is clearly heard saying ""It's true!"" All in all, ""Jesus Is Magic"" (named after what SIlverman's boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel believes and tells his kids) is a very funny, slightly less daring than it should be, movie. But it is hilarious nontheless. 1 Hour, 17 Minutes Not Rated, but contains references to just about every single STD and bodily funtion imaginable, including constant usuage of the f-word. 9 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse manicallyhip 4.0 out of 5 starsJesus Is Magic Review June 1, 2006 Format: DVD Sarah Silverman is one of my favorite comedians and I just loved her off-beat and controversial humor she displays throughout the movie.

1554,0422528,"Narrative digressions on sex, race, politics, and more from comedienne Sarah Silverman.I love Sarah Silverman. I love her jokes, her songs, her face. So it saddens me that this is supposed to be her big break for a DVD. Even with Liam Lynch directing and helping write the song, it just never excels.Some really good material appears on this movie -- some of her best jokes, and at least one really good song (""You're Gonna Die Soon""). But there is a lot of filler. The backstage scenes are not funny and serve little purpose, the opening and closing really are not funny, and the closing song is mildly amusing but more childish than clever. Worst of all, twenty minutes of jokes are stretched to 45 minutes due to a lot of pauses and silences. What we hear is great, but we have to wait too long to hear it. Cutting the video down in time, or adding more jokes would really have done wonders as far as keeping me laughing.But there is hope. She has her own show now, which is doing well, and has one of the most memorable scenes from ""The Aristocrats"". So Sarah Silverman is just getting started, I think.

1555,0422528,"Sarah Silverman--with her gummy smile, coltish stance, and clear voice which bubbles up from deep within her chest--wants to come on like a huggable shock comedienne, yet she's more performance artist than stand-up personality. Cleverly and carefully (one may say 'precisely') dropping taboo words into her stories, Silverman gets laughs by pretending to lead the audience in one direction and then undercutting those expectations with a surprising low-keyed zinger. Silverman doesn't overwork a punchline--which are often nestled in the context of her stories anyhow--although she returns to older topics too often. Also, she relies far too much on pseudo-cute facial expressions and aw-shucks body language to soften the blows of her words, though the topics (9/11, the Holocaust, AIDS, vaginal sex versus anal sex) are tiptoed through in a facetious yet frisky manner. The fantasy edits, imagining Sarah in different manners of celebrity, work well, better than the purposefully-wooden prologue and epilogue with friends. Still, one expects to laugh more with such touchy material. Silverman is so laid-back and blasé, it's clear to viewers she is giving them a made-up creation. Other shock comics manage to make audiences feel as if they are hearing something true, but this personality that Silverman is displaying (playful, naughty, grounded, unaffected) is unabashedly artificial. This is entirely deliberate on Silverman's part, yet is tends to render her act phony: smoke and mirrors prodding at the national funny bone. *1/2 from ****",0,,ur0989035,26 December 2009,0,,147,131,6.755102040816326,0.891156462585034,"('silverman', 4)('yet', 3)('one', 3)('sarah', 2)('clear', 2)('shock', 2)('personality', 2)('words', 2)('stories', 2)('often', 2)","['sarah', 'silvermanwith', 'gummy', 'smile', 'coltish', 'stance', 'clear', 'voice', 'bubbles', 'deep', 'within', 'chestwants', 'come', 'like', 'huggable', 'shock', 'comedienne', 'yet', 'shes', 'performance', 'artist', 'standup', 'personality', 'cleverly', 'carefully', 'one', 'may', 'say', 'precisely', 'dropping', 'taboo', 'words', 'stories', 'silverman', 'gets', 'laughs', 'pretending', 'lead', 'audience', 'one', 'direction', 'undercutting', 'expectations', 'surprising', 'lowkeyed', 'zinger', 'silverman', 'doesnt', 'overwork', 'punchlinewhich', 'often', 'nestled', 'context', 'stories', 'anyhowalthough', 'returns', 'older', 'topics', 'often', 'also', 'relies', 'far', 'much', 'pseudocute', 'facial', 'expressions', 'awshucks', 'body', 'language', 'soften', 'blows', 'words', 'though', 'topics', 'holocaust', 'aids', 'vaginal', 'sex', 'versus', 'anal', 'sex', 'tiptoed', 'facetious', 'yet', 'frisky', 'manner', 'fantasy', 'edits', 'imagining', 'sarah', 'different', 'manners', 'celebrity', 'work', 'well', 'better', 'purposefullywooden', 'prologue', 'epilogue', 'friends', 'still', 'one', 'expects', 'laugh', 'touchy', 'material', 'silverman', 'laidback', 'blasé', 'clear', 'viewers', 'giving', 'madeup', 'creation', 'shock', 'comics', 'manage', 'make', 'audiences', 'feel', 'hearing', 'something', 'true', 'personality', 'silverman', 'displaying', 'playful', 'naughty', 'grounded', 'unaffected', 'unabashedly', 'artificial', 'entirely', 'deliberate', 'silvermans', 'part', 'yet', 'tends', 'render', 'act', 'phony', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'prodding', 'national', 'funny', 'bone']"

1557,0422528,"Sarah Silverman is known for a sarcastic sense of humor so if you don't like sarcasm at the highest level you should not even start watching this show. That's what I don't get about the negative reviewers on here. What did you expect? A lighthearted piece of stand-up-comedy? You know it's not going to be that so why do you even bother? I'm a big fan of that kind of humor, the just on the edge humor, humor that makes people feel bad but you know it's just a joke so you do enjoy it. Sarcasm is just not for everybody, some people are just too limited to understand that. You should be able to laugh at anything, as long as you don't hurt somebody specifically. I didn't really mind about the singing and the other off stage scenarios though, to me that was not the best part of the show. The best part is Sarah Silverman standing on stage, beginning a story, pausing, and then the bad punt comes out. You wonder what it will be, you expect it, you know it will be bad, and then you get it in your face and that's the fun part. I read someone said that he wondered if he could laugh with her jokes if she was not good looking. That's utterly stupid. Humor has nothing to do with how you look.

1559,0422528,"A comedienne who looks like a cross between Marlo Thomas and Sandra Bullock pretty much can command the attention of an audience for 70 minutes even if her material is uneven. Sarah Silverman, Jewish and sassy, is neither borscht-belt loud nor SNL smooth; she's just out to gross you out with her out-there racism, sexism, and self-defecating humor.Silverman is funny at times, fails sometimes, and smiles most of the time to let you know she's cute enough to get away with stuff Jon or Martha Stewart wouldn't dare for fear of alienating their WASP audiences. In this way she's closer to Sarah Bernhard and Steve Chappelle, or maybe Richard Pryor without his manic delivery and Joan Rivers without her Jewish crutches.So what do I consider offensive and funny? Try ""The best time to have a baby is when you're a black teenager."" What do I consider offensive and not funny? Try singing ""You're gonna die"" in a nursing home and then shaking grandma's corpse in a casket. That reminds me--whenever she's not on stage, she's not funny, as if the stage protects her from the PC police and her own poor writing. At least a third of the film is staged offstage, so you have an idea why I award it barely a ""B."" Judging it only as film-making would land an unarguable ""C"" for its awkward editing and uninspired camera-work (the film repeats the same long shots and close ups as if it were a crime to vary from a lockstep pattern). It has an amateur look even for the low demands of documenting a stand-up act.As it turns out, I spent some of the time admiring her as she does herself in a mirror, making out with herself on that mirror. Now that's a bit I never saw before. I did laugh at her girlish correction of a PC violation: ""When I say 'retards,' I mean they can do anything.""

Silverman is strikingly beautiful, and startlingly filthy-mouthed. The result is comedy that is not actually funny per se, but is funny because of the incredible contrast between what you expect and what Silverman delivers.I've noticed that most reviewers can't refrain from quoting some lines from her performance. The problem with that practice is that if you read enough reviews, you've basically seen the movie. I'm going to refrain from revealing any part of her act. I'll just say that Silverman makes jokes about matters that society assumes can't be funny--9/11, racism, world hunger, AIDS. Silverman delivers her act in a neutral, confidential way. The contrast between Silverman's straightforward, level manner and the nature of her comedy is what makes her unique. My guess is that Silverman's humor would wear thin on repeated viewing. However, for the 72 minutes of this movie, she's very, very funny.Notes: Silverman was profiled in the 10/24/05 issue of The New Yorker magazine, in an article titled ""Quiet Depravity.""

1562,0422528,"Sarah Silverman is clever, hilarious and sucker-punches you with unanticipated reversals. She's one of the most skillful current young comics at prickly and violating humor that cuts through the watered-down amateurism of so many modern male comedians who kill their own timing with a rock-star façade and stadium atmosphere. Silverman is tall, brunette and certainly attractive, and she says outrageous things with the clear-cut diction and self-assurance of a girl who was raised knowing how to make a good impression. The detach between what she says and how she says it is part of the effect. If you're going to use not merely the homeless and the handicapped but sacred cows like cancer, AIDS and 9/11 in jest, it's good to know how to pick up the go-ahead from the audience. Her way of doing that is by seeming as if to be too polite to understand what she's saying. When she uses the word ""retards"" she at once clarifies that it's offensive and explains: ""When I say 'retards,' I mean they can do anything."" None of her shticks last long enough to develop. She gets a laugh, and then another one, a third, then quits while she's ahead and goes off on another trajectory. We want her to persist more, heaping one political black eye on top of another. We want to see her in a groove.Jesus is Magic is not the best showcase for that like it should be, seeing as it's a theatrically released feature film. There are episodes of her show The Sarah Silverman Program on Comedy Central that strike comedy gold. Jesus is Magic hardly even plays as a greatest hits tape by comparison to the episode in which Sarah becomes enraged with the Mongolians after learning that her Russian ancestors were raped by them, or the one where she tries to raise awareness about 9/11 by staging a play in which the Twin Towers are speaking characters and a performer dressed in black tights stretches his arms out and chases them, to which they respond with lines like, ""I'm a nice building! Why are you doing this to me?"" Here, she cuts away from the performance to small sketches. The opener, in which her sister Laura and her friend Brian Posehn boast about their recent endeavors, is funny because she impeccably plays someone who has never finished anything and never will, and lies about it. Then we see her in a car, singing a song about getting a job and doing a show, and then she does a show. No problem. But what's with the scene where she amuses the elderly folks at her grandma's nursing home by singing a song telling them they'll all die soon? It works owing to the ostensible oblivion of the old people, but to talk about the film's editing pattern is to imply it has one. There are brusque and sudden cuts between various forms of material: She's on stage, then she's at the nursing home, back on stage. There's a way to make that changeover, but it doesn't necessitate a cut that seems like she was barged in on in the middle of something. And the movie ends too hurriedly, lacking any sort of culmination or conquest in the material. Her act seems brought to a halt a mile before the border. The 70-minute running time is worthy of note, because if you take away the offstage scenes, we see less of her than a live audience would.If Silverman were untalented or her material wasn't funny, those criticisms would've been a lot easier to write. I love Sarah Silverman. She has a genuine flair, and she is hilarious in a way that's her own. And, as I described before, I think she is skillful at honing writers to her distinctive, self-consciously low-brow style. Jesus is Magic is still a fun watch, but it's mostly because of inestimably hilarious one-liners that she springs on you in pitch-perfect form with the persona I've described, like ""I was licking jelly off of my boyfriend's penis and all of a sudden I'm thinking, 'Oh my god, I'm turning into my mother!'""

1564,0422528,"""Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic"" features very funny comedian stuck in a very bad movie. At her stand-up Silverman can be the master of her instrument. Yet, here she is stuck in a movie that is distracting and disorganized. It is part concert film, part variety show. The former works, but the latter is like throwing a rock through the rest of the movie. You're left with the intense urge to hit the fast-forward button.Silverman has, like all stand-up comedians, a specialty. Yet her act is somewhat different than the usual comedians who stick to time-weathered material about the everyday battles with the universe like sex, politics, coffee shops and microwave ovens. Instead she talks about edgy subjects such like AIDS, race, pornography, even 9/11, and then punctuates her comments with shocking commentary. She pushes herself into unhealthy waters and her fearlessness is brought home by the fact that she doesn't seem to be bulldozing the material by being crass or mean. There's poise and intelligence to her delivery. She is pretty and well-mannered but her words take an unexpected U-Turn into commentary that is shocking. ""I believe that the best time to have a baby is . . . when you're a black teenager"" she tells us. That's offense, and it's funny.Part of the problem with her first movie ""Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic"" is that there's not enough of that. Her act has a conversational flow to it, a pattern of beginning as something mundane but then ending it with something shockingly un-PC. Yet, the movie breaks this pattern every few minutes by bad skits and musical numbers of no consequence. We came to see her stage act, I think the image she wants to project (at least on stage) is the image of a person who is insecure but unaware of the racist and sexist language that she uses. That's fine, but it requires an artist who can orchestrate it like music. She's done it before, but somehow it all falls flat here. There needed to be some measure of consistency. Throw out the lame sketches and the music and get down to the business of doing what she does best. Sadly, it's not here.*1/2 (of four)",0,,ur0310469,13 February 2014,0,,186,152,6.263440860215054,0.8172043010752689,"('movie', 5)('like', 5)('silverman', 3)('yet', 3)('act', 3)('sarah', 2)('jesus', 2)('magic', 2)('stuck', 2)('bad', 2)","['sarah', 'silverman', 'jesus', 'magic', 'features', 'funny', 'comedian', 'stuck', 'bad', 'movie', 'standup', 'silverman', 'master', 'instrument', 'yet', 'stuck', 'movie', 'distracting', 'disorganized', 'part', 'concert', 'film', 'part', 'variety', 'show', 'former', 'works', 'latter', 'like', 'throwing', 'rock', 'rest', 'movie', 'youre', 'left', 'intense', 'urge', 'hit', 'fastforward', 'buttonsilverman', 'like', 'standup', 'comedians', 'specialty', 'yet', 'act', 'somewhat', 'different', 'usual', 'comedians', 'stick', 'timeweathered', 'material', 'everyday', 'battles', 'universe', 'like', 'sex', 'politics', 'coffee', 'shops', 'microwave', 'ovens', 'instead', 'talks', 'edgy', 'subjects', 'like', 'aids', 'race', 'pornography', 'even', 'punctuates', 'comments', 'shocking', 'commentary', 'pushes', 'unhealthy', 'waters', 'fearlessness', 'brought', 'home', 'fact', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'bulldozing', 'material', 'crass', 'mean', 'theres', 'poise', 'intelligence', 'delivery', 'pretty', 'wellmannered', 'words', 'take', 'unexpected', 'uturn', 'commentary', 'shocking', 'believe', 'best', 'time', 'baby', 'youre', 'black', 'teenager', 'tells', 'us', 'thats', 'offense', 'funnypart', 'problem', 'first', 'movie', 'sarah', 'silverman', 'jesus', 'magic', 'theres', 'enough', 'act', 'conversational', 'flow', 'pattern', 'beginning', 'something', 'mundane', 'ending', 'something', 'shockingly', 'unpc', 'yet', 'movie', 'breaks', 'pattern', 'every', 'minutes', 'bad', 'skits', 'musical', 'numbers', 'consequence', 'came', 'see', 'stage', 'act', 'think', 'image', 'wants', 'project', 'least', 'stage', 'image', 'person', 'insecure', 'unaware', 'racist', 'sexist', 'language', 'uses', 'thats', 'fine', 'requires', 'artist', 'orchestrate', 'like', 'music', 'shes', 'done', 'somehow', 'falls', 'flat', 'needed', 'measure', 'consistency', 'throw', 'lame', 'sketches', 'music', 'get', 'business', 'best', 'sadly', 'four']"
1565,0422528,"In this semi unique stand-up hybrid, Silverman mocks her own persona, her own show, and everything else that crosses her mind to mock. She basically mocks mockery at this point in her jadedness, being consumed by her ironic cynicism's and while the material in this performance introduces initiates into Sarah's unique female views, it does not really elevate her style from what fans had already confirmed in her. While exposing and demonstrating so many of the social hypocrisies that keeps her joke book ripe with material, Silverman's need to go to extremes to shock her audiences may come of as a bit cheap to snobs and fans that can see so much more to her character and wit then the shock value; still the fact remains that few people in the national spotlight, much less female, are bold enough to go to that lucid mentality that places no borders around the containment of a joke for sake of offending. While professional female comedian's like the up and coming Lisa Lampanelli use this shock value and unfiltered honesty to embarrass the crowd of mostly men into laughs, the rare breed like Sarah delves way deeper into the fractured psyche inside all of us, and captivates with it's uncomfortable ramifications. Basically a synopsis of many of her thematic ideas come pouring out in random intervals as she edit's in a few music clips and some funny backstage satire.

Ever since her short stint on ""Saturday Night Live"", I knew she was a brilliant comedienne. Part of her appeal is her natural good looks and charming nature. She seems sweet and innocent, but what comes out of her mouth is often filthy and offensive. She delivers it straight with a style that is both perky and deadpan. She has a contradictory self-deprecating confidence that makes her rather unique in the world of stand-up comedy.There's some misguided musical numbers and ""skits"" that are never quite as funny as they are conceptually.

1567,0422528,"Not funny ha-ha but funny no-one-heard-me-snicker-at-that-right? With Don Rickles now eight-five years old, Sam Kinison ironically dead at the hands of 16 year old drunk driver and Andrew ""Dice"" Clay's shallow talent reservoir completely exhausted, a gap exists in the market for highly offensive race-based comedy. This movie presents Sarah Silverman's staking out of that ground. Silverman produces none of the show-stopping belly laughs that Kinison could in the years before cocaine and alcohol convinced him that singing along to early 70's rock songs constituted entertainment. Viewers will find little in Silverman's act worth sharing with coworkers at the water cooler next day (Kinison's fans still remember certain of his material). This is not to suggest that the movie lacks entertainment value or that some lines don't elicit a minor titter. Rather, Silverman's talent is in getting the audience on her side with smart, politically incorrect observations and then leading them to a place so improper that they their fear overwhelms their smug hipness. She also does an excellent job of using her innocent good looks to amp up the shock value. Her attempt to provide value for money by including some videotaped vignettes along with footage of a Los Angeles show is largely misguided as the skits, like her ill-fated MTV show, feel forced. Some of them may have worked had she inflicted them on real audiences - Borat-like (for example, an extraordinarily offensive song sung to supposed nursing home residents may have actually been funny if Silverman actually went in and assaulted the elderly in a real nursing home).

Is she offensive? Who can even say anymore. Pushing the boundaries of good taste in the year 2007 means a young woman can now stand on stage and tell ""in depth"" bathroom jokes one after another without clearing the house. Example:Sarah: Cause now I'm at that point where I'm comfortable peeing in front of my boyfriend, and you know its kinda nice...now Im going to try it in the bathroom. Not just A bathroom joke, but perhaps the Oldest bathroom joke in the catalog. Eyes on the prize ladies, lol. To be fair, the show isn't all 80 year old jokes and vaudeville/burleque.

1570,0422528,"I didn't know much about Sarah ""The Big S"" Silverman before I saw this movie but based on the trailer, I knew this movie was going to be one I had to see. So today, I ventured to the theater to see what ""Jesus is Magic"" was all about.""Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic"" is part stand-up and part music video. The movie talks about a whole bunch of different topics including the Holocaust, racism, sex, 9/11, AIDS, and our society in general. Lots of funny moments ensue After I watched ""Jesus is Magic"" this afternoon, I can't say I was blown away with the film however I was impressed. I have read several reviews online about the movie which state that the music video parts of the movie is where the movie looses steam but I beg to differ, I think the stand-up skits make the movie loose steam. In fact, I think the music videos were the overall funniest parts. You have to really give Sarah Silverman a pat on the back though for singing songs like ""I Love you more"" and ""You're going to die soon"" because songs like that take balls to create let alone sing and she did both.The stand-up part of the movie was funny but at times seemed to drag on. I think the problem with the stand-up routine was that I paid money to see this in a theater and normally people don't watch stand-up routines in the movie theater but on TV on HBO or Comedy Central. But hey don't get me wrong I enjoyed this film quite a bit and I think on a whole it was pretty darn good.What I liked most about the movie was all the subject matters it covered and the jokes that went with them. I swear Sarah Silverman and director Liam Lynch are lucky to be alive. They make fun of every race or type of person in this film: black, white, Chinese, Mexican, Jewish, gay, straight, you name it and Sarah made fun of it. I guess I really enjoyed seeing something like this, something so ballsy and edgy. This is a movie that actually made you look around the theater and question yourself on whether or not you should laugh, that's not something that happens every day when you see a movie.The only other thing I had a problem with was the running time. This movie barely clocks in at an hour and fifteen minutes and with ticket prices the way they are at the theater even for a matinée, I am not sure if most would say the running time is worth the price of admission. The shortest a movie should be is an hour and a half now with ticket prices the way they are. I personally felt that the movie just flew by and when it ended, everyone seemed to say the same thing, wow that was short.So in the end, ""Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic"" is a very funny movie but it does have its share of minor flaws. I would be surprised if anyone could sit through this entire movie and not feel offended at least once. I wasn't offended that much but at times some jokes were really harsh and edgy but hey that's the whole point of the film. I wish they would come out with the soundtrack because I loved all the songs in the flick; all of which were created and sung by The Big S herself. Sarah Silverman has won me over and can now call me a fan. If you are already a fan, run to the theater and check this baby out. If your not a fan and aren't offended by crude and edgy jokes check out ""Jesus is Magic"" I think you will be pretty impressed.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic"" is a 7/10.

1571,0422528,"Basically a stand-up session enriched by skits. Silverman is exceedingly funny, capitalizing on her beauty, the sweet blankness of some of her expressions, especially mild puzzlement as the audience reacts to some of her over-the-top lines. She has a filthy mouth and a filthy mind and says the most outrageous things as if respect and decorum were annoying nuisances to be swept away with a comment or a laugh. Somehow her riffs on racism and other tricky subjects pass through offensiveness and come out the other side as brilliant satire of society's often hypocritical observance of ""tolerant"" values. Some of the skits are a little tediousthe framing device with her sister about putting on a show is strained and overlong, and the folksinger at the old-folks' home and the grandmother's funeral bit is overlong, sapping its potency like so many Saturday Night Live sketches did by staying past its welcome. A couple of the songs are really very funnySilverman can sing, and her band (the Silvermen) is pretty good. It's a nice touch having them wear their hair in two ponytails, like hers in some parts of the movie. And the stand-up is often brilliant and always entertaining.

1572,0422528,"To start off, I love Sarah Silverman's comedy. Most Gen X'ers have seen her in bits on HBO's Mr. Show or School of Rock or some other comedic cameo piece, so it was to be foreseen that a DVD would be released showcasing her talent more head-on, much like Margaret Cho or David Cross' older DVDs directed towards the same audience. I thought that this was to be a feature film (like David Cross in Run Ronnie Run) starring her, but instead it was more live-show-meets-pre/pro-meets-long-skit kind of show, which made it very original and entertaining.Liam Lynch's work is more known around these comedians' circles, especially by directing two or three surreal shorts for Tenacious D's (Jack Black's band) DVD released a year or two before this came out. He, again, has a very surreal style of directing while conveying the comedic approach to his work. In this release, he melds a simple story of a comedienne and her real-time (yet obvious thought-ahead) writing of a live comedy show to impress her friends. She goes from acting to ""singing"" to doing stand-up comedy to doing a short skit with Bob Odenkirk (from Mr. Show as well) back to stand up and you get the idea.The comedy was funny. I didn't know what to expect from her live show, mostly because everything I've seen her in (except the Aristocrats) has been scripted material that I couldn't tell if she wrote or what. I didn't care for the racial humor that she is trying to push the button so hard for in the film, especially when jokes got replayed as song-material later on in a bad directorial move, I think. The somewhat-music-video style was interesting, but again the jokes were rehashed after hearing them in her standup. Her jokes were missing at times as well, and dare I say, I heard an accidental retelling of a Jeff Foxworthy joke (when he mentioned that his nephew says ""Airpane! Airpane!"" and points in the sky, he retorts that he's 14 years old) but she talks about her 7 year old niece who recently told her mother that she was a lesbian. Yikes...Most of her comedy, as a down-side again, is based around her being Jewish and that's supposed to be funny. And she also has a very bad ego throughout the entire thing (which she makes fun of, I think, at the end). She also has a very easily played-out joke style where she'll just throw random names (Martin Luther King, Jr.) or absurd notions into the air and bat them around with wordplay.But this, ultimately, is why I like her comedy and therefore, gave it an above average rating. It's just very hard to be force-fed all of her attitudes on everything at once.",0,,ur3177690,29 June 2006,0,,236,191,5.927966101694915,0.809322033898305,"('comedy', 6)('show', 5)('like', 3)('around', 3)('style', 3)('jokes', 3)('seen', 2)('mr', 2)('comedic', 2)('dvd', 2)","['start', 'love', 'sarah', 'silvermans', 'comedy', 'gen', 'xers', 'seen', 'bits', 'hbos', 'mr', 'show', 'school', 'rock', 'comedic', 'cameo', 'piece', 'foreseen', 'dvd', 'would', 'released', 'showcasing', 'talent', 'headon', 'much', 'like', 'margaret', 'cho', 'david', 'cross', 'older', 'dvds', 'directed', 'towards', 'audience', 'thought', 'feature', 'film', 'like', 'david', 'cross', 'run', 'ronnie', 'run', 'starring', 'instead', 'liveshowmeetsprepromeetslongskit', 'kind', 'show', 'made', 'original', 'entertainingliam', 'lynchs', 'work', 'known', 'around', 'comedians', 'circles', 'especially', 'directing', 'two', 'three', 'surreal', 'shorts', 'tenacious', 'ds', 'jack', 'blacks', 'band', 'dvd', 'released', 'year', 'two', 'came', 'surreal', 'style', 'directing', 'conveying', 'comedic', 'approach', 'work', 'release', 'melds', 'simple', 'story', 'comedienne', 'realtime', 'yet', 'obvious', 'thoughtahead', 'writing', 'live', 'comedy', 'show', 'impress', 'friends', 'goes', 'acting', 'singing', 'standup', 'comedy', 'short', 'skit', 'bob', 'odenkirk', 'mr', 'show', 'well', 'back', 'stand', 'get', 'ideathe', 'comedy', 'funny', 'didnt', 'know', 'expect', 'live', 'show', 'mostly', 'everything', 'ive', 'seen', 'except', 'aristocrats', 'scripted', 'material', 'couldnt', 'tell', 'wrote', 'didnt', 'care', 'racial', 'humor', 'trying', 'push', 'button', 'hard', 'film', 'especially', 'jokes', 'got', 'replayed', 'songmaterial', 'later', 'bad', 'directorial', 'move', 'think', 'somewhatmusicvideo', 'style', 'interesting', 'jokes', 'rehashed', 'hearing', 'standup', 'jokes', 'missing', 'times', 'well', 'dare', 'say', 'heard', 'accidental', 'retelling', 'jeff', 'foxworthy', 'joke', 'mentioned', 'nephew', 'says', 'airpane', 'airpane', 'points', 'sky', 'retorts', 'hes', 'years', 'old', 'talks', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'recently', 'told', 'mother', 'lesbian', 'yikesmost', 'comedy', 'downside', 'based', 'around', 'jewish', 'thats', 'supposed', 'funny', 'also', 'bad', 'ego', 'throughout', 'entire', 'thing', 'makes', 'fun', 'think', 'end', 'also', 'easily', 'playedout', 'joke', 'style', 'shell', 'throw', 'random', 'names', 'martin', 'luther', 'king', 'jr', 'absurd', 'notions', 'air', 'bat', 'around', 'wordplaybut', 'ultimately', 'like', 'comedy', 'therefore', 'gave', 'average', 'rating', 'hard', 'forcefed', 'attitudes', 'everything']"
1573,0422528,"I've seen Sarah Silverman in plenty of films and TV appearances, but this is my first time seeing her stand-up act in its entirety. Altogether, I enjoyed the film. I'm sure this won't appeal to all tastes, especially if you're easily offended. I wouldn't say Sarah is nearly as good as George Carlin or Richard Pryor or other classic envelope-pushing comedians, but she is good and definitely has a unique comic style (not something I say about many comedians nowadays). I like the way she delivers her profane, offensive humor in such a mundane fashion. I think it makes the jokes even funnier. The flaw in her comedy, in my opinion, is that despite her significant intelligence and wit, Sarah does have a silly, absurd side. Some of the musical numbers definitely bordered on the silly side. Altogether, the film is hit-or-miss, thankfully with more hits.

1574,9482786,"I probably like this one the least of all his specials but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. I think that it would be really funny to people who have never seen him before but to those of us who have seen his other specials this is pry at the bottom. What is wrong with people? Is my favorite.A few thoughts...it seemed like he was tired or not completely all in on this one. It also seems like he is becoming a caricature of himself. He seemed to be acting how he thought people wanted him to and not how he would genuinely act nor did he come across as natural. It was almost like he got a little too confident he could pull this off without rehearsing it more-like he was winging it. His bits just weren't fully developed or thought through. He had two really good bits in this one but the rest kind of didn't quite hit the mark. He had opportunities to keep the bits going but they ended without going anywhere and I would have liked to hear him keep going on the subjects he brought up.It's ironic that the title of this is Stay Hungry but it's never covered in his set and more importantly staying hungry is a term used to decribe staying on the grind or continually trying to work towards a goal. It implies you're not taking anything for granted...but it seemed as if he was kind of resting on his laurels in this one. He was doing bits everyone has done a million times before-air travel, emotional suppport animals, childbirth, Italian stereotypes, etc...but he brought nothing new to them. They are easy topics that any person standing around the water cooler could riff about and in fact I've heard funnier conversations about these things amongst some of my acquaintances.He had two bits that stood out. One was a bit on being paranoid when having to stop at a mini-mart late at night for gas. I was crying I was laughing so hard at that one. He also did one other bit about having to take the car to a body shop to get work done on it. That was also really well done and hilarious.Overall I kept waiting for him to really ""bring it"" like he's done in the past but this one kind of felt like he just threw a bunch of stuff together without really having worked the bits all the way through to satisfying conclusions. Even the ending did not seem to land. It was out of nowhere and caught me off guard. It sounded like he had tried with the bit...realized it wasn't landing and knew he had nothing else so he just abruptly stopped. Comedians should have the audience laughing hysterically by the end. People should leave the experience on a real high feeling good about having set aside time to come to hear the act. This one ended and I felt none of those things. If anything I felt kind of embarrassed for him. He's gotten this far and perhaps this is as good as it gets and he just can't wring anything else out of his family and his background. To be honest some parts were cringeworthy. Also I feel bad for his family. Before in his bits it seemed good-natured but in this one he seemed to be working out some real anger issues with his family. It was kind of brutal and mean-spirited.I really like him and want to see him succeed but this got me thinking maybe he just isn't intelligent enough to keep coming up with fresh material. He has admitted that he isn't very smart and doesn't know much about most things and it doesn't sound like he is comfortable being out in the world. I think in order to be a good comedian you have to be out and about having lots of interactions otherwise what can you bring to the table?I had been eagerly awaiting his next special so I was really expecting a big deal SO I was surprised when I kind of felt like I didn't ""get my money's worth"" on this one. I know not every set is gonna be a huge hit and I get that it's hard to come up with fresh material but I guess I was expecting more.All those things don't make me like him any less. He's very funny just standing there because of his big features and the way he throws his body into everything. These are simply observations.

1579,9482786,"SM has two specials on Netflix. The first one ""Aren't you embarrassed?"" Came at a time when I didn't know who this guy was. But I literally laughed all the way through. His jokes had great timing, were relatable and to this day, I can watch that performance and still laugh at some of the jokes like I just heard them for the first time.Stay Hungry is NONE of that. And it's a shame because when I saw this was out, I dropped everything to watch it. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's totally disjointed. So many of his jokes fall flat that it was almost cringy to witness, considering the incredibly large venue he was performing in; Radio City Music Hall.There were a few parts that were genuinely funny, but the few parts that managed to get me to at least smile in this special, were more simply the fillers in the last one. That's how bad this one is in comparison.Lastly this I'll say is that Sebastian is talented funny comedian, but I think they jumped the gun having him play this venue and if I had to guess, I think it made him try too hard. His last special everything was natural, almost as if he were reacting in the moment. This special, everything is forced, especially his signature physical gestures and perpetually annoyed persona that made him so funny leading up to this.

1588,9482786,"Ten minutes into Sebastian Maniscalco's new Netflix special ""Stay Hungry"" I hadn't even cracked a smile; fifteen minutes in, I was checking how much was left in the special.Maniscalco's characteristic Italian affect defines his new Netflix special. He speaks in short bursts, leaving ends of sentences hanging, and this blunt style comes through in the way he writes his comedy. Within the first fifteen minutes of the special he's run through multiple anecdotes, each less entertaining than the last. When I did finally crack a smile around the twelve-minute mark, it was during a story that would have had me in stitches had it been in the hands of a more gifted comedian. Punch lines that require earnestness are treated with derision, which ruins the joke entirely. By the time I was halfway through the special, the judgmental tone that Maniscalco is known for had become monotonous and grating.All good comedians should be great storytellers and Maniscalco is not. His stories are disjointed and frequently interrupted to tell random bits from his life and share small pieces of information about his family throughout. There is no sense of plot or climax to any of his stories; the whole hour feels like you are listening to a three-year old telling you what happened at school that day. He feels flighty, easily distracted, and hard to follow.""Stay Hungry"" gives the impression that Maniscalco has difficulty finding topics to write his comedy about. He spends the first half of the special running through anecdotes at lightning speed, with none landing particularly well. Around the halfway mark he digs into his longest story, which is about the birth of his one-year-old daughter. It's Maniscalco's trademark style to find fault with everything around him and the birth of his child is no different. He derides the hospital, the nurses, his family and in-laws, himself, and everything about the process of childbirth. It would take a gifted comedian to make complaining about childbirth funny, and Maniscalco is not this comedian. When he finishes the story, you feel uncomfortable and confused as to what you are supposed to be laughing about.Maniscalco tries to be a physical comedian, and it almost works for him. He paces across the stage, derisively mimics those who he tells his stories about, and uses his expressive Italian face to exemplify his disgust with the world at large. But it's hard to combine the use of physical humor with the angry-at-the-world comedy that Maniscalco relies on. Truly great physical comedians like Martin Short walk around the stage with a sense of joy about everything - they throw themselves into their physicality with an earnestness that demands that you take them at face value. Maniscalco uses physical comedy to mock the people in his world, and it often comes across as bland and distasteful. There's no doubt that he has a great stage presence, but he can't quite figure out how to use it to his advantage.He's lucky that he has such a large stage presence because Radio City Music Hall is a big stage to fill. Despite being a sold-out show, it lacks the energy that came with John Mulaney's Radio City special last year. Maniscalco's audience become experts in polite laughter over the course of the hour and the larger pieces of applause feel forced by long pauses. With ""Kid Gorgeous"" you could feel from watching at home how much the audience was enjoying Mulaney's presence, and despite the fact that Mulaney does not engage with his audience in a traditional sense you can feel the give-and-take relationship between them. This aspect of stand-up is absent with Maniscalco - you get the distinct feeling that he is talking into a mirror.""Stay Hungry"" is the first comedy special I have watched in a very long time where I didn't laugh once. If you want to hear a middle-aged Italian complain about the world, listening to someone on the New York City subway would probably be funnier; if you want an hour of comedy, re-watch your favorite special again instead. I promise it's a better use of your time.",0,,ur97918890,18 January 2019,0,,363,258,6.460055096418733,0.7107438016528925,"('special', 8)('maniscalco', 7)('comedy', 6)('stage', 5)('around', 4)('comedian', 4)('feel', 4)('physical', 4)('minutes', 3)('maniscalcos', 3)","['ten', 'minutes', 'sebastian', 'maniscalcos', 'new', 'netflix', 'special', 'stay', 'hungry', 'hadnt', 'even', 'cracked', 'smile', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'checking', 'much', 'left', 'specialmaniscalcos', 'characteristic', 'italian', 'affect', 'defines', 'new', 'netflix', 'special', 'speaks', 'short', 'bursts', 'leaving', 'ends', 'sentences', 'hanging', 'blunt', 'style', 'comes', 'way', 'writes', 'comedy', 'within', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'special', 'hes', 'run', 'multiple', 'anecdotes', 'less', 'entertaining', 'last', 'finally', 'crack', 'smile', 'around', 'twelveminute', 'mark', 'story', 'would', 'stitches', 'hands', 'gifted', 'comedian', 'punch', 'lines', 'require', 'earnestness', 'treated', 'derision', 'ruins', 'joke', 'entirely', 'time', 'halfway', 'special', 'judgmental', 'tone', 'maniscalco', 'known', 'become', 'monotonous', 'gratingall', 'good', 'comedians', 'great', 'storytellers', 'maniscalco', 'stories', 'disjointed', 'frequently', 'interrupted', 'tell', 'random', 'bits', 'life', 'share', 'small', 'pieces', 'information', 'family', 'throughout', 'sense', 'plot', 'climax', 'stories', 'whole', 'hour', 'feels', 'like', 'listening', 'threeyear', 'old', 'telling', 'happened', 'school', 'day', 'feels', 'flighty', 'easily', 'distracted', 'hard', 'followstay', 'hungry', 'gives', 'impression', 'maniscalco', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'topics', 'write', 'comedy', 'spends', 'first', 'half', 'special', 'running', 'anecdotes', 'lightning', 'speed', 'none', 'landing', 'particularly', 'well', 'around', 'halfway', 'mark', 'digs', 'longest', 'story', 'birth', 'oneyearold', 'daughter', 'maniscalcos', 'trademark', 'style', 'find', 'fault', 'everything', 'around', 'birth', 'child', 'different', 'derides', 'hospital', 'nurses', 'family', 'inlaws', 'everything', 'process', 'childbirth', 'would', 'take', 'gifted', 'comedian', 'make', 'complaining', 'childbirth', 'funny', 'maniscalco', 'comedian', 'finishes', 'story', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'confused', 'supposed', 'laughing', 'aboutmaniscalco', 'tries', 'physical', 'comedian', 'almost', 'works', 'paces', 'across', 'stage', 'derisively', 'mimics', 'tells', 'stories', 'uses', 'expressive', 'italian', 'face', 'exemplify', 'disgust', 'world', 'large', 'hard', 'combine', 'use', 'physical', 'humor', 'angryattheworld', 'comedy', 'maniscalco', 'relies', 'truly', 'great', 'physical', 'comedians', 'like', 'martin', 'short', 'walk', 'around', 'stage', 'sense', 'joy', 'everything', 'throw', 'physicality', 'earnestness', 'demands', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'maniscalco', 'uses', 'physical', 'comedy', 'mock', 'people', 'world', 'often', 'comes', 'across', 'bland', 'distasteful', 'theres', 'doubt', 'great', 'stage', 'presence', 'cant', 'quite', 'figure', 'use', 'advantagehes', 'lucky', 'large', 'stage', 'presence', 'radio', 'city', 'music', 'hall', 'big', 'stage', 'fill', 'despite', 'soldout', 'show', 'lacks', 'energy', 'came', 'john', 'mulaneys', 'radio', 'city', 'special', 'last', 'year', 'maniscalcos', 'audience', 'become', 'experts', 'polite', 'laughter', 'course', 'hour', 'larger', 'pieces', 'applause', 'feel', 'forced', 'long', 'pauses', 'kid', 'gorgeous', 'could', 'feel', 'watching', 'home', 'much', 'audience', 'enjoying', 'mulaneys', 'presence', 'despite', 'fact', 'mulaney', 'engage', 'audience', 'traditional', 'sense', 'feel', 'giveandtake', 'relationship', 'aspect', 'standup', 'absent', 'maniscalco', 'get', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'talking', 'mirrorstay', 'hungry', 'first', 'comedy', 'special', 'watched', 'long', 'time', 'didnt', 'laugh', 'want', 'hear', 'middleaged', 'italian', 'complain', 'world', 'listening', 'someone', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'subway', 'would', 'probably', 'funnier', 'want', 'hour', 'comedy', 'rewatch', 'favorite', 'special', 'instead', 'promise', 'better', 'use', 'time']"

1591,10332256,"Not liking this isn't a declaration of my politics; it's a subjective look at humor, the most subjective art form there is. This just wasn't funny for me and that has nothing to do with my views on the world. I certainly wasn't offended or shocked or reduced to an indignant pile of bigotry.I thought I'd give Hannah Gadsby another try. HG is someone you will either like or who will bore you to tears. You will enjoy being lectured to for an hour, or don't need a lecture, and some of us really, really don't need a lecture. I count myself among those who don't need to be set straight on sexual politics, pardon the word choice.Americans are stupid because we say ""gas"" instead of ""petrol"" because petrol is a liquid and gas isn't, except ""gas"" is short for ""gasoline,"" I wanted to scream. The whole bit on language differences between Americans and Australians was tired and devoid of a single moment of humor.It didn't sound like HD made the audience laugh, although they mostly applauded on cue at every beleaguered point about sexual politics, which they all seemed to be in lock-step with, as if they had read a rule book on how to act before the show. It reminded me of the audience at a classical music concert who know not to clap until the end of the movement.I think she's quite good as a performer, something I appreciated more in this comedy special than in Nanette.Hannah Gadsby being offended just isn't my idea of humor, and she seems to relish being offended, being offended is her prime form of entertainment. She's offended by some guy who vomits out the tired thing about smiling takes less work than frowning.

1592,10332256,"Nanette was obviously a huge deal when it came out- I remember the hype and a family member eventually convincing me to watch it, but to go in knowing as little as possible. I'm glad I followed that advice, because it was a very surprising stand-up performance; in a good way, of course. The people who criticise it for not being consistently funny are technically right, but it had a whole lot more to offer, and its power came from the fact that it wasn't obviously heading in the direction that it did go in.Following up one of the best Netflix standup specials (I'd say if not for Bo Burnham's Make Happy and What, Nanette would be the best standup special produced by the platform) wouldn't have been easy, but I really liked Gadsby's approach here. She gets quite meta right off the bat, and the direct delivery makes sense when it becomes apparent quite early on that the show is going to be at least partly about her experiences with autism. It's interesting and eye-opening without being as heavy as the themes touched upon in Nanette.That last point is both a strength and maybe a weakness, which is acknowledged as much by Gadsby in her opening breakdown of the proceeding routine, stating that she ""used up"" most of her trauma in Nanette, in a way. As a result, Douglas contains more laughs but probably won't stick with viewers quite as much as her first special.I'd ultimately say they're both very strong though, just in their own ways. If anything, this proves Gadsby is far from a one-trick pony, and doesn't need to rely on pulling the same genius move she did in Nanette by going from standup comedy to borderline standup tragedy, which would be a whole lot less genius if repeated. The reliance on humour shouldn't suggest that the show is too much weaker though, because Gadsby has a unique and genuinely funny way of talking about things, which really makes her stand out from the crowd of comedians using Netflix as their primary platform.(It's also cool to see someone from Australia make it big in the standup world, but that's just a person bias on my end due to also being Australian.)",0,,ur26226712,27 May 2020,0,,195,160,6.056410256410256,0.8205128205128205,"('standup', 6)('nanette', 4)('way', 3)('quite', 3)('much', 3)('gadsby', 3)('obviously', 2)('came', 2)('go', 2)('funny', 2)","['nanette', 'obviously', 'huge', 'deal', 'came', 'remember', 'hype', 'family', 'member', 'eventually', 'convincing', 'watch', 'go', 'knowing', 'little', 'possible', 'im', 'glad', 'followed', 'advice', 'surprising', 'standup', 'performance', 'good', 'way', 'course', 'people', 'criticise', 'consistently', 'funny', 'technically', 'right', 'whole', 'lot', 'offer', 'power', 'came', 'fact', 'wasnt', 'obviously', 'heading', 'direction', 'go', 'infollowing', 'one', 'best', 'netflix', 'standup', 'specials', 'id', 'say', 'bo', 'burnhams', 'make', 'happy', 'nanette', 'would', 'best', 'standup', 'special', 'produced', 'platform', 'wouldnt', 'easy', 'really', 'liked', 'gadsbys', 'approach', 'gets', 'quite', 'meta', 'right', 'bat', 'direct', 'delivery', 'makes', 'sense', 'becomes', 'apparent', 'quite', 'early', 'show', 'going', 'least', 'partly', 'experiences', 'autism', 'interesting', 'eyeopening', 'without', 'heavy', 'themes', 'touched', 'upon', 'nanettethat', 'last', 'point', 'strength', 'maybe', 'weakness', 'acknowledged', 'much', 'gadsby', 'opening', 'breakdown', 'proceeding', 'routine', 'stating', 'used', 'trauma', 'nanette', 'way', 'result', 'douglas', 'contains', 'laughs', 'probably', 'wont', 'stick', 'viewers', 'quite', 'much', 'first', 'specialid', 'ultimately', 'say', 'theyre', 'strong', 'though', 'ways', 'anything', 'proves', 'gadsby', 'far', 'onetrick', 'pony', 'doesnt', 'need', 'rely', 'pulling', 'genius', 'move', 'nanette', 'going', 'standup', 'comedy', 'borderline', 'standup', 'tragedy', 'would', 'whole', 'lot', 'less', 'genius', 'repeated', 'reliance', 'humour', 'shouldnt', 'suggest', 'show', 'much', 'weaker', 'though', 'gadsby', 'unique', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'way', 'talking', 'things', 'really', 'makes', 'stand', 'crowd', 'comedians', 'using', 'netflix', 'primary', 'platformits', 'also', 'cool', 'see', 'someone', 'australia', 'make', 'big', 'standup', 'world', 'thats', 'person', 'bias', 'end', 'due', 'also', 'australian']"

Addressing the uses of ""words you can't call people"" he expertly spews forth a barrage of epithets, which only make us more aware that we may be a little more racist than we would like to think ourselves as. The same time he talks about how our own language has evolved over the years: what once we called trailer homes, now we call mobile homes, partly-cloudy has become partly-sunny, cripples become physically challenged.It's sometimes hard to laugh at Carlin. There are moments when instead of laughing, you stop and think: because he's saying the truth, and the truth ""ain't pretty"". The uncomfortable situations we find ourselves in, the ease in which one can offend feminists, the hilarity of rape (and the possibility that one day, instead of being called ""rape victims"" they will be names ""involuntary sperm recipient"" makes our use of political correctness questionable.

1656,11177308,"This was my first look at Tom Papa, and although he wasn't bust a gut funny, I do appreciate the poignant observations about everyday life that he characterizes in a humorous way. His main schtick in this comedy special was informing the audience that they were as good as they were ever going to get, and for all intents and purposes, that was great, hence the title of the show. I could see how some folks might get turned off by that message, but he massages it to the point that you don't consider it a downer. Filmed in New Jersey before a home town crowd, this didn't appear to be done in a major venue, as the audience is shown in a socially distanced setting at tables set the way they might be in a night club.

New Rule: ""We get it . . . more or less"" You don't have to explain your references. When you use a good reference and we're laughing, ride the wave. No further explanation is required. Otherwise it's like a form of reverse-heckling. Or, like watching the narrated version of Bladerunner at the peak of a beautifully crafted scene, to have it destroyed by a voice-over. (That's a reference by the way).New Rule: ""Truth in advertising."" For example, any of your guests, the politicians, scientists, doctors, not in the entertainment industry, don't have to be entertaining. However, I have every expectation for you to be. If you want to stick to your rant on a singular topic or do an impromptu roast on someone in absentia, then say so upfront. Wait! I may be wrong. The title does say Live from Oklahoma, not Live Comedy from Oklahoma. Sorry, please feel free to disregard this one.New Rule: ""Read the room."" Actually this is an old rule. For, every good comedian knows when to pivot to the funny stuff. If you don't remember how, just watch some of your past show's political guests as they try ""not"" to answer a question. With all those writers, couldn't you spare one to help with some alternate jokes? I haven't seen someone bomb this bad since your gal-pal Ann Coulter on the Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. (That's ref number two).New Rule: ""Network."" I'm sure there's an excellent support system for you, so use it. For example, do the LA Show-biz lunch thing with Dennis Miller and Eddie Murphy. They too used to be funny. However, they don't come off looking like a douche. Perhaps they can give you some tips. Bill, you have one of the most topical and important shows on TV with Real Time. Even when comparing to Jon Stewart and your immediate neighbor, John Oliver. You have an eclectic and stellar collection of guests such as, Seth MacFarlane, Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and one of my favorites, the late Werner Klemperer (Colonel Wilhelm Klink) who had several appearances on Politically Incorrect, and even guest hosted like Seth did. But unlike Jon and John, your talk/news show skills didn't translate to a solo performance. Are you just better with guests that effectively punctuate your run-on rants? Lastly, 5 starz to Amazon for refunding my purchase of this vid. Excellent service as always.

If you too are a fan of hers then you know exactly what you're in for because with Ellen...what you see is truly what you get. Her incredibly unique talent for pointing out the obvious, using biting sarcasm, and an awkward sort of uncomfortability in certain situations makes us laugh at ourselves and at her. One thing Ellen has never been is a ""shock"" comedienne and it simply isn't necessary for her and wouldn't look right on her. That's why I was a little disappointed that she felt the need to throw in literally a sparse amount of curse words. I'm not a prude, language doesn't bother me in the least but I like when entertainment avoids it so that everyone can appreciate it. She uses it so little that it just would have been better without it. The very first thing she addresses is her ""coming out"" and does so in an emotionally charged and touching way that makes you smile like almost everything she does.I have never seen anyone who is just so inherently likable. She has such incredible chemistry and is so down to earth. Her style and her comedy and the way she speaks to people is simply a God given gift and you can see all that come out on stage. I don't find her uproariously funny necessarily, I didn't have tears streaming down my cheeks but she is just so great to watch. One of the best things about this video is at the end during the credits when we see audience members addressing her. It is sweet and touching and proves how instrumental she is in making people smile. She is a brilliant comedienne and this is a great special to check out.

So on to my personal reason why I was barely able to watch this till the end:Ellen to me is like a person in a wheelchair who everybody feels sorry for. Because she got treated badly after she ""came out"" there's now almost this unwritten obligation and sense of right to applaud to everything she says and does. It's pathetic! I condemn the spiteful reactions towards her coming out & everything, but empathy stops at a certain point. What's happened in Ellen's case is that now her loving and devoted fans are mostly people who've been hurt themselves. So they gobble her every word as if it came from high above...Ellen is to her fans what the AMWAY director is to his devoted fanatical ant workers.The most she made me was smile on a couple of occasions, but the crowd seemed to want to eat her up. Everything was to-die hysterical to them and I couldn't fathom it. Her material wasn't really bad, but her delivery and timing were painful to watch. She was waaaaay too predictable and what's even worse, she went for the cheapest laughs: ""God...is a She"" (and the mostly female crowd bursts into applause)Somewhere towards the end she even steals stuff from other comedians, but by that time I had already begun writing this woeful comment.

Jokes in the show include those about hotels, sex, schools and teachers, dating and relationships, and trying to improve his regional accents in comedy, using key phrases, including with Scouse, Belfast, Geordie, Welsh, Manchester, Scottish, West Country, Birmingham, Essex, Yorkshire, Australian and Jamaican. There are more jokes with animated pictures for visualisation, based on Ideas, Thoughts, Social, Health, Religion, Sport, Technology, Pornography, Sex (phrase ""adult supervision""), Relationships (phrases ""partner"" and ""housewife"", and his favourite joke with the word ""custardy""). After asking from audience members if they have an interesting job or claim to fame, he interviews a Funeral Director named John, and on the screen behind him the audience are part of a secret to freak him out when Jimmy makes up a joke. Other jokes in the show include about audience members tea-bagging, the 69, how rude jokes go, his impression of a lesbian breakup, and he has an audience member having to turn off their phone. There is a bit where he asks for Heckling, which he loves, and you have audience members shout about not being able to see Peter Kay, hating his Walkers Jimmy Con Carne flavour, wanting comedy, and being a posh prick, and two of the audience members he uses his paper fortune teller to give him a good rude insult.

1748,0251654,"I believe Richard Pryor to be the best stand-up comic of all-time (closely followed in the social-critic realm by Bill Hicks and George Carlin), but Dave Chappelle is promising to be a worthy successor. This HBO special from 2000 has achieved something of a cult status on peer-to-peer networks since its airing, especially in audio form, and as such has gained even more popularity since Chappelle's venture into Comedy Central's ""Chappelle's Show"" (which is finishing its third and apparently final season right now).Looking back, I find this to be even funnier than his comedy show. Whereas his (hilarious) sketch show can become a bit repetitive at times and is almost always dealing with racial stereotypes and such, ""Killin' Them Softly"" touches on everything - beginning with blacks and whites (""DC has changed!""), moving on to crime, then television shows, and of course marijuana.My personal favorite bit has got to be Chappelle's observations on children's entertainment. He remarks how Pepé Le Pew is practically a rapist and encourages children to ""take the pussy(cat)"" and how racist ""Sesame Street"" was. (""Yeah, Oscar! You're a grouch."" - ""I live in a trash can! What do you expect!"") Don't forget The Count: ""I know a pimp when I see one!"" To be honest I've found Chappelle's television show to become a bit stale sometimes (even though I'm a huge fan of it) but I was blown away - his stand-up comedy is even better. It's rare that I find myself laughing out loud at comedy acts, but even without watching him on stage, his vocal performance is gut-busting. The 911 phone call bit is classic.I don't want to discredit Richard Pryor and say this is funnier, but if you listen to some of Pryor's older stuff, Chappelle is touching on the same issues as he did in the 1960s and '70s and is, at times, actually doing it even funnier. Of course, Chappelle has some way to go before matching Pryor's iconic status or even his later fusion of outrageous comedy and social satire in the mid-'70s through the early '80s (which surpasses the stuff here), but those comparing him to Pryor have a reason to do so.",0,,ur1173088,28 July 2006,0,1.0,196,159,6.188775510204081,0.8112244897959183,"('even', 7)('comedy', 5)('chappelles', 4)('show', 4)('bit', 4)('pryor', 3)('chappelle', 3)('funnier', 3)('richard', 2)('standup', 2)","['believe', 'richard', 'pryor', 'best', 'standup', 'comic', 'alltime', 'closely', 'followed', 'socialcritic', 'realm', 'bill', 'hicks', 'george', 'carlin', 'dave', 'chappelle', 'promising', 'worthy', 'successor', 'hbo', 'special', 'achieved', 'something', 'cult', 'status', 'peertopeer', 'networks', 'since', 'airing', 'especially', 'audio', 'form', 'gained', 'even', 'popularity', 'since', 'chappelles', 'venture', 'comedy', 'centrals', 'chappelles', 'show', 'finishing', 'third', 'apparently', 'final', 'season', 'right', 'nowlooking', 'back', 'find', 'even', 'funnier', 'comedy', 'show', 'whereas', 'hilarious', 'sketch', 'show', 'become', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'times', 'almost', 'always', 'dealing', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'killin', 'softly', 'touches', 'everything', 'beginning', 'blacks', 'whites', 'dc', 'changed', 'moving', 'crime', 'television', 'shows', 'course', 'marijuanamy', 'personal', 'favorite', 'bit', 'got', 'chappelles', 'observations', 'childrens', 'entertainment', 'remarks', 'pepé', 'le', 'pew', 'practically', 'rapist', 'encourages', 'children', 'take', 'pussycat', 'racist', 'sesame', 'street', 'yeah', 'oscar', 'youre', 'grouch', 'live', 'trash', 'expect', 'dont', 'forget', 'count', 'know', 'pimp', 'see', 'one', 'honest', 'ive', 'found', 'chappelles', 'television', 'show', 'become', 'bit', 'stale', 'sometimes', 'even', 'though', 'im', 'huge', 'fan', 'blown', 'away', 'standup', 'comedy', 'even', 'better', 'rare', 'find', 'laughing', 'loud', 'comedy', 'acts', 'even', 'without', 'watching', 'stage', 'vocal', 'performance', 'gutbusting', 'phone', 'call', 'bit', 'classici', 'dont', 'want', 'discredit', 'richard', 'pryor', 'say', 'funnier', 'listen', 'pryors', 'older', 'stuff', 'chappelle', 'touching', 'issues', 'times', 'actually', 'even', 'funnier', 'course', 'chappelle', 'way', 'go', 'matching', 'pryors', 'iconic', 'status', 'even', 'later', 'fusion', 'outrageous', 'comedy', 'social', 'satire', 'early', 'surpasses', 'stuff', 'comparing', 'pryor', 'reason']"

Many comedians seem to have a hook, they seem to rely on this hook to shape their act. Dave Chappelle just knows how to combine many elements to produce an interesting act.

Perhaps this is because the specials are allowed to exceed one hour, and are completely uncensored. Whatever the reason may be, HBO knows good comedy, and knows how to pick their performers. They often choose well-established comedians to perform. Because of this fact, I was shocked to learn that Dave Chapelle, a somewhat unknown for his comedy, was getting his own HBO special. Another shocking fact for me was that, when I actually saw the performance, I was blown away by how funny it was. After that, I was immediately a Dave Chapelle fan. This is without a doubt one of the greatest comedy specials that I have ever seen. It is up there with Dana Carvey's ""Critics Choice"", George Carlin's ""Complaints and Grievances,"" Carlin's ""You're All Diseased,"" Robin Williams ""Live on Broadway,"" and a select few episodes of Comedy Central Presents on my all time favorite comedy specials. This hilarious special has a wide range of jokes, from commentary on the presidency, to a great bit about Sesame Street. It was this special that prompted me to give Chapelle show a chance in its first season.

Part one-woman show, part callback to her stand up sets of the nineties, and part greatest bits from her show Ellen; Relatable mixes and matches these various elements to keep her diehard fans on the edge of their seats.There is definitely some edge to the one-woman show sections with Ellen talking about the death of a young lover or about losing all her friends and becoming depressed. Ellen though has such a nice demeanor that these stories come across without the bitterness one would expect. This takes some of the edge off the individual stories but the overall effect fits better with the rest of the show.She also does some bits that I assume are from her talk show. Showing pictures of cute cats and dancing like an elderly white person to rap music. These have a America's Funniest Home videos kind of feel to them. They are amazing in space but I had already forgotten them the next day and had to look them up for this write-up.Her actual stand up bits are both the most pleasant surprise and a bit of a trip down memory lane. Simple well crafted observational humor of the type Ellen was well known for when both herself and Paula Poundstone ruled the female comic roost. Some of the jokes are certainly familiar (A junk drawer bit really?) but all the observations are very relatable which conveniently is the title of her piece.For a second opinion, my wife laughed out loud quite a bit and seemed to enjoy herself even more than I did.Ellen seems to be riding the same wave that Jim Gaffigan has been riding recently with simple and pleasant observational humor making a comeback against the Sarah Silvermans and the Bill Burrs of the world. If Ellen knows one thing it is where the zeitgeist is.Even though she dresses as if she were Steve Jobs, Ellen comes across as a person who is being nice. This is different than being a nice person mind you. I am unsure of that. I have the feeling she wanted to tear into some people, places, and things but she contained her rage cause it was off brand.

1818,12087624,"I'll say first and foremost that I could completely understand somebody refusing to watch this, even if they were a fan of CK before his reputation changed due to the #MeToo Movement. He addresses it here and there in this new standup show, but not to the extent of Aziz Ansari in his most recent special, and likely not in a way that will get anyone outraged by his actions back on his side.It's a complicated situation due to the fact that yes, he's admitted he did these things, but that his recollection differs from those he's been accused by. Then there's the whole matter of him being punished without a formal conviction: some would say his reputation suffering was not enough of a punishment, while some would claim he shouldn't have been punished at all by non-traditional, online/social media-driven forms of justice.Where you fall on the spectrum of whether it's okay to support or even just enjoy CK is entirely up to you. For me personally, the idea of paying for a special of his two years ago may have felt icky, while now, I feel like he may deserve a second chance. And I say this while respecting anyone who does not feel as forgiving as me. And of course, should more serious allegations come out, or if he was to be charged in as official and binding a manner as Harvey Weinstein, such support would feel uncomfortable.Anyway, that's all preamble, and the long story made short is that you don't have to support him if you feel it's disrespectful to his accusers, and you can support him if you still feel comfortable with doing so. I did, and while it was strange at first, he won me over, and I soon remembered why I used to proudly say he was my favourite comedian.Truth be told, he still has a tremendous amount of comedic skill, and I laughed out loud numerous times throughout this hour-long special. It's not quite his best work, and there were a couple of jokes here and there that didn't land, but his sense of timing, delivery, and knowing when to cross certain lines for maximum comedic effect were all impeccable. I don't know if delving into his experience with #MeToo in more detail would have made this better exactly. Maybe it would've been more interesting, but probably less funny. It's hard to say whether it would have made for a better overall show.I have seen many decent to good standup specials over the last couple of years, and while it takes a lot of skill to deliver an hour of good material, it's rare to see somebody deliver an hour of mostly great material. One needs a huge amount of skill to make telling jokes on stage a greatly entertaining experience. In Sincerely Louis CK, he does just that, delivering incredibly funny jokes at such speed that an hour flies by. It could be the start of a solid comeback, or maybe just a one-off. It's a mystery how the public as a whole will respond to his attempts to put himself out there again, but I'm glad he made this, while admittedly having some trepidation about watching it initially.Even showing my support for it now feels somewhat risky, but few comedians have made me laugh as much as CK has, and so I feel a need to put that out there. In time, I think he should have the right to atone and continue producing material, just as those who continue to feel displeased with his past behaviour have a right to ignore his future work. Of course maybe it's not that simple, and maybe future revelations will complicate things further.But for now, all I can say for certain is that this special is very funny and not far behind CK's past work in terms of quality. People who still consider themselves fans- or who are at least open to the idea of forgiveness- should check it out as soon as possible.",0,,ur26226712,5 April 2020,0,,317,238,6.110410094637224,0.750788643533123,"('feel', 7)('say', 6)('would', 5)('support', 5)('made', 5)('ck', 4)('special', 4)('maybe', 4)('still', 3)('skill', 3)","['ill', 'say', 'first', 'foremost', 'could', 'completely', 'understand', 'somebody', 'refusing', 'watch', 'even', 'fan', 'ck', 'reputation', 'changed', 'due', 'metoo', 'movement', 'addresses', 'new', 'standup', 'show', 'extent', 'aziz', 'ansari', 'recent', 'special', 'likely', 'way', 'get', 'anyone', 'outraged', 'actions', 'back', 'sideits', 'complicated', 'situation', 'due', 'fact', 'yes', 'hes', 'admitted', 'things', 'recollection', 'differs', 'hes', 'accused', 'theres', 'whole', 'matter', 'punished', 'without', 'formal', 'conviction', 'would', 'say', 'reputation', 'suffering', 'enough', 'punishment', 'would', 'claim', 'shouldnt', 'punished', 'nontraditional', 'onlinesocial', 'mediadriven', 'forms', 'justicewhere', 'fall', 'spectrum', 'whether', 'okay', 'support', 'even', 'enjoy', 'ck', 'entirely', 'personally', 'idea', 'paying', 'special', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'may', 'felt', 'icky', 'feel', 'like', 'may', 'deserve', 'second', 'chance', 'say', 'respecting', 'anyone', 'feel', 'forgiving', 'course', 'serious', 'allegations', 'come', 'charged', 'official', 'binding', 'manner', 'harvey', 'weinstein', 'support', 'would', 'feel', 'uncomfortableanyway', 'thats', 'preamble', 'long', 'story', 'made', 'short', 'dont', 'support', 'feel', 'disrespectful', 'accusers', 'support', 'still', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'strange', 'first', 'soon', 'remembered', 'used', 'proudly', 'say', 'favourite', 'comediantruth', 'told', 'still', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'comedic', 'skill', 'laughed', 'loud', 'numerous', 'times', 'throughout', 'hourlong', 'special', 'quite', 'best', 'work', 'couple', 'jokes', 'didnt', 'land', 'sense', 'timing', 'delivery', 'knowing', 'cross', 'certain', 'lines', 'maximum', 'comedic', 'effect', 'impeccable', 'dont', 'know', 'delving', 'experience', 'metoo', 'detail', 'would', 'made', 'better', 'exactly', 'maybe', 'wouldve', 'interesting', 'probably', 'less', 'funny', 'hard', 'say', 'whether', 'would', 'made', 'better', 'overall', 'showi', 'seen', 'many', 'decent', 'good', 'standup', 'specials', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'takes', 'lot', 'skill', 'deliver', 'hour', 'good', 'material', 'rare', 'see', 'somebody', 'deliver', 'hour', 'mostly', 'great', 'material', 'one', 'needs', 'huge', 'amount', 'skill', 'make', 'telling', 'jokes', 'stage', 'greatly', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'sincerely', 'louis', 'ck', 'delivering', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'jokes', 'speed', 'hour', 'flies', 'could', 'start', 'solid', 'comeback', 'maybe', 'oneoff', 'mystery', 'public', 'whole', 'respond', 'attempts', 'put', 'im', 'glad', 'made', 'admittedly', 'trepidation', 'watching', 'initiallyeven', 'showing', 'support', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'risky', 'comedians', 'made', 'laugh', 'much', 'ck', 'feel', 'need', 'put', 'time', 'think', 'right', 'atone', 'continue', 'producing', 'material', 'continue', 'feel', 'displeased', 'past', 'behaviour', 'right', 'ignore', 'future', 'work', 'course', 'maybe', 'simple', 'maybe', 'future', 'revelations', 'complicate', 'things', 'furtherbut', 'say', 'certain', 'special', 'funny', 'far', 'behind', 'cks', 'past', 'work', 'terms', 'quality', 'people', 'still', 'consider', 'fans', 'least', 'open', 'idea', 'forgiveness', 'check', 'soon', 'possible']"
1819,12087624,"First off: It contains a BUNCH of blasphemy jokes... It's considered a sign of an untalented comedian, if the comedian harps-on about one particular subject or uses the same premise repeatedly, and Louis did several jokes about religion.I am a big fan of Louis and I hold his previous stand-ups ""Shameless"" (2007), ""Chewed Up"" (2008) and ""Hilarious"" (2010) in high esteem. Unfortunately in recent times (actually the past decade) Louis hasn't put out anything really amazing, like he did in the old days. Maybe he's just getting old? A decade can make a huge difference in somebody's life, and although you'd expect a comedian to just get better and funnier as they get more experience, I'm afraid that in reality this simply isn't true... for example: Bill Burr AND Dave Chappelle used to be absolutely hilarious (top 5 comedians alive), but the both of them (just like Louis) haven't put out anything good in the past few years... so no, comedians DON'T get better with age apparently. They have a good few years and then it's over.And I'm sorry but if Louis can only make me laugh twice after I've listened to him for a whole 60 minutes, then he's clearly not as funny as he used to be.

And it takes you sort of by surprise. Nobody really expects to be confronted by their very nature out of nowhere like this. And the resulting laughter feels like that moment when somebody catches you making superhero poses in the frozen vegetable aisle.

How are you gonna get away with that, Blade Arms McFlashPose?

1851,2883224,"The challenge with this kind of review is whether to review the comic or to review the material or just throw in the towel and do both.A one of a kind comic. So real it hurts. The first thing you notice is that she is a natural beauty, even when she is not trying. This somewhat distracts from the material, but she knows, and she works it. So it is part of the act.The next thing you notice is that her material so deep, so experimental, so I-don't-care-if-u-laugh that you are compelled to listen that much more carefully, to try to capture the experience not just the joke.Like most comics operating in the rarefied air she prefers, she could do easier (and funnier) material, but she would probably sooner have a root canal. Or whatever the ""painful female equivalent"" of a root canal is.A few years back, a brave film-maker did a documentary on the one ""forbidden"" joke that comics only ever told to each other, but never to the public. Not kidding. A real joke involving a lot of ad-libbing which every comic had a variation of, but the public had never heard of.The film-maker then went to a dozen or so top comics and had them do their version of the joke on camera. Some of the best comics in the world participated. But Silverman was generally considered to have been the funniest in the film, not merely because she told the joke but because she managed to do a segue where the joke (supposedly) triggered a suppressed memory. ""My agent raped me,"" she said deadpan to the camera, halfway through the joke. ""I just remembered that my agent raped me."" Now, that does not SOUND funny but, in context, it was drop dead funny.And so it is with this special. If you get into the context and pay attention more to the artist than the material (which is not always the way comedy works) it is quite a treat.Carlin was like that at the end of his life.

1853,2883224,"I had the misfortune of watching Sarah's HBO Special 'We Are Miracles' with a religious conservative. Someone that completely understands the material but yells, ""That Bitch"" when the rape jokes come. On the plus side Sarah was able to breach the stone heart of that Jesus lover and get her to laugh with me. Amazing how that happens.Sarah is a great comedian. Definitely my favorite comedian, but I found that she was telling previous jokes I'd already heard on talk shows or read from her Twitter profile ... And as well from older pieces of her memoir 'The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee'.Yes, the show was funny overall ... don't get me wrong, but I'm not one to spare the feelings of anybody - even if I do love the smell of their poo.A special on HBO should have been built on all new material and I felt cheated of that. Maybe in the same way I feel cheated after watching every Kathy Griffin show on Bravo. When someone keeps talking about the same things over & over again. It loses my attention, because it's stale & predictable. I demand more of Sarah, because she genuinely enjoys making us laugh. Much more than she desires to fill every seat in a theater.There was also the problem of watching Bill Cosby on Comedy Central first. I found Sarah following an act that had set the tone for me. Cosby isn't trying to be ""edgy"" ""controversial"" or whatever terminology comedians use today ... Bill was just trying to make me laugh ... and he's a pro at that. He engages the audience and can just talk to his fans completely unrehearsed.I find Sarah does very little of that (unless a heckler attacks her) she pretty much ignores her audience and sticks to the routine. That's one step away from reading your jokes off of cards to me. During a LIVE I'd go stupid if she acknowledged me during a LIVE performance. There at The Largo she had an audience of maybe 40 people she just talked at. I see so many people begging for just the smallest nugget from her that they ""heckle"" just to get that attention.I guess my final word here would be that Sarah continues to play to the same selection of fans and give people what they expect from her.

1854,2883224,"Sarah Silverman is a comedian that's always been around, but an artist I never directly got into by chance. I watched a few episodes of The Sarah Silverman Program, which was too obscure for my taste. But I always enjoyed her cameo in Judd Apatow's Funny People, Louie and thought she gave an effective supporting performance in Sarah Polley's Take This Waltz. I enjoyed clips of her standup online, but have not seen her perform a complete comedy hour till now.The decision to shoot the special at the Largo Comedy Club in front of 39 people is a great one. Silverman never looks far off into the distance or above to a balcony booth. There's no big giant TV screen of her in the background for the cheap seats. The intimacy of the Largo lends itself for Silverman's raunchy off-the-wall random tangent comedy, giving her much more freedom to roam from topic to topic without transitions. ""I don't need segue ways."" Silverman quips, ""The brain doesn't work that way.""Some of the joke highlights were a childhood story of how her older sister used to scare her, sin atonement in Christianity and a bit about the Make A Wish foundation. It's nice how much politically incorrect jokes she gets away with, showing an affable innocent girly persona can really go a long way to make hard topics durable.The whole experience is more akin to a live show, as Silverman is able to milk laughs from silences and even counter critique audience reactions when they aren't up to par. It's always awkward when comedians do audience interaction in big theater shows and this completely fixes that. The reactions from the 39 people create a more potent, immersive connection to Silverman's perspective.

She's not Jennifer Lopez - who is as over-exposed as you can possibly be.I'm a huge Tiffany Haddish fan and I always look forward to seeing her appear on things - I especially loved her on the Letterman Netflix show. And I do love her stand up but it gets to be a bit much: the pandering to the audience but I guess that's the point: people WANT that. he Jewish angle of it all did make it very interesting and even educational in some ways. But for some reason, as much as I love female comedians, there's a certain over-the-top bombastic quality that they are resorting to that makes it seem like they are making up for material that is lacking. Watch the first 5 minutes of the Iliza Schlessinger special - with the screaming from what seems like an Oprah audience and the flames and fire... it's just ridiculous.

For sure there is no ""white guys do this / Hispanic guys do this"" material.Instead what we get is a surprisingly gentle wander through Cholos, a cleaner in a drug induced haze, parenthood, massage and Mexican day workers. Although a lot of it plays on racial clichés, it is never cruel or demeaning but rather matter-of-fact and familiar; even if it is not so to me, he presents it in such a way that it is comfortable and engaging. It would have been nice if he had some of the edge that he can sometimes have on the Daily Show, but it does still work. The hour gives a good hatful of laughs but generally has a good feeling of amusement, which I liked. If you like him on The Daily Show then for sure this special is worth checking out even if it is a bit different from his TDS material.",0,,ur1002035,8 June 2014,0,,121,102,6.0578512396694215,0.8429752066115702,"('show', 4)('daily', 3)('material', 3)('madrigal', 2)('like', 2)('special', 2)('hour', 2)('get', 2)('hispanic', 2)('although', 2)","['seen', 'madrigal', 'like', 'people', 'correspondent', 'role', 'daily', 'show', 'someone', 'grown', 'since', 'arriving', 'result', 'decided', 'check', 'comedy', 'central', 'special', 'material', 'suggests', 'madrigals', 'whole', 'hour', 'going', 'type', 'material', 'get', 'laugh', 'hispanics', 'okay', 'hispanic', 'saying', 'things', 'doesnt', 'count', 'indeed', 'risk', 'leads', 'obvious', 'thing', 'ends', 'trapped', 'show', 'fall', 'trap', 'although', 'madrigal', 'course', 'uses', 'raceculture', 'foundation', 'act', 'something', 'defines', 'act', 'sure', 'white', 'guys', 'hispanic', 'guys', 'materialinstead', 'get', 'surprisingly', 'gentle', 'wander', 'cholos', 'cleaner', 'drug', 'induced', 'haze', 'parenthood', 'massage', 'mexican', 'day', 'workers', 'although', 'lot', 'plays', 'racial', 'clichés', 'never', 'cruel', 'demeaning', 'rather', 'matteroffact', 'familiar', 'even', 'presents', 'way', 'comfortable', 'engaging', 'would', 'nice', 'edge', 'sometimes', 'daily', 'show', 'still', 'work', 'hour', 'gives', 'good', 'hatful', 'laughs', 'generally', 'good', 'feeling', 'amusement', 'liked', 'like', 'daily', 'show', 'sure', 'special', 'worth', 'checking', 'even', 'bit', 'different', 'tds', 'material']"

1900,9310314,"I really like Amanda Seales. She is really funny in the HBO show Insecure but this was kind of cringe-worthy. I thought we were all past using the n-word and that it had been established that no one should be using that word regardless of race but she used it throughout the entire show and the audience was clapping and laughing every time.America is divided enough with everyone being offended by everything. We need to try to see the things we have in common not focus on what makes us different and that is what you hear most people of color express commonly and yet this special did nothing but paint white people out to be awful and black people to be better than white people. Not sure how that's helpful. It's a shame because she has all the elements of a good comic. She's very expressive and energetic, her stories seemed well thought out, she seemed at ease and comfortable on stage, she engaged the audience BUT something about this just felt inauthentic and forced plus she covered all the same stereotypical things that have pretty much been done before by everyone.I get that she was performing to a mostly black audience and therefore her show was geared towards that but all races and genders watch HBO too and like her as an actress so you would have thought she would've tried to keep that in mind. She did have a little speech in the beginning before she got on stage pointing out who the show WASN'T for...she should have included white people because this show is not for you if you are. She specifically called out white people throughout the show and not any other race which is pretty hypocritical. Can you imagine the outrage if a white comic got on stage and said stuff like ""Black people do this and that and I don't like it."" That person would be shamed, lose their career (rightfully so) and they'd never be able to show their face in public again...but yet Amanda does it and it's ok? I get that some people will say ""Well she can do that because of oppression etc..."" To which I say-there has to be certain ground rules in place for everyone. Not every white person is evil.

1902,9310314,"I follow Amanda Seales pretty closely, I like her a lot. I think she's hilarious and intelligent (though often a bit dramatic- but artist you know) and I'd probably call myself a fan but this just wasn't as great as it was hyped up to be.I think the main problem was that it was just super predictable, like it was just a compilation of stuff she says all the time compiled in a semi new way. It also seemed like she was trying to incorporate some of the ""Smart Funny & Black"" show aspects that just didn't fit quite right in the special (like singing the black national anthem, it went just a beat long enough to make it awkward).And on the one hand, I get that it's her first comedy special, she was using some of the classic Seales humor that people have come to love her for. On the other hand, there was no real surprise elements, no truly memorable jokes. It seemed like she was just trying to create a special of like quotes/phrases everybody would walk away repeating all the time with the ""how black am i gone have to get"" or ""i be knowin"" which is kind of already repeated among the IG fan base (similar to Kevin Hart's, ""pineapples"", ""you gone learn today"" or Bernie Mac's ""milk & cookies"")...but for the most part it just kind of fell flat.I also think she isn't an artist who takes criticism very well, even if it's well meaning. In a sense it's good she doesn't like live to please fans, she's just authentically who she is. However, everyone's not hater and if future specials fall flat like this she's not gonna reach her ultimate potential. I think it's especially hard with a semi-political special like this to separate haters from fans who just weren't feeling it. It might be easy for her to say, oh it just got low ratings cause white people were hating or cause I wasn't politically correct.And don't get me wrong, there are definitely a lot of people (mostly white) who are just mad the special wasn't about them or made to please them...despite the fact that she told yall what it was before the special started. And the fact is, she was sharing legitimate and real aspects of the experience of being a black woman in America. It doesn't mean she thinks all white people are bad, it means black people and black women encounter a lot of white people and micro aggressions throughout our lives that are annoying/hurtful and funny.However, there are also a lot if people like me (a fellow black woman btw) who legitimately are just criticizing the writing/pacing/delivery aspects of the special and hoping it gets better...who I also think she'll probably write off as hating or not getting it.",0,,ur54751222,18 March 2019,0,,254,187,5.767716535433071,0.7362204724409449,"('like', 10)('black', 7)('special', 7)('people', 7)('think', 5)('lot', 4)('also', 4)('white', 4)('shes', 3)('wasnt', 3)","['follow', 'amanda', 'seales', 'pretty', 'closely', 'like', 'lot', 'think', 'shes', 'hilarious', 'intelligent', 'though', 'often', 'bit', 'dramatic', 'artist', 'know', 'id', 'probably', 'call', 'fan', 'wasnt', 'great', 'hyped', 'bei', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'super', 'predictable', 'like', 'compilation', 'stuff', 'says', 'time', 'compiled', 'semi', 'new', 'way', 'also', 'seemed', 'like', 'trying', 'incorporate', 'smart', 'funny', 'black', 'show', 'aspects', 'didnt', 'fit', 'quite', 'right', 'special', 'like', 'singing', 'black', 'national', 'anthem', 'went', 'beat', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'awkwardand', 'one', 'hand', 'get', 'first', 'comedy', 'special', 'using', 'classic', 'seales', 'humor', 'people', 'come', 'love', 'hand', 'real', 'surprise', 'elements', 'truly', 'memorable', 'jokes', 'seemed', 'like', 'trying', 'create', 'special', 'like', 'quotesphrases', 'everybody', 'would', 'walk', 'away', 'repeating', 'time', 'black', 'gone', 'get', 'knowin', 'kind', 'already', 'repeated', 'among', 'ig', 'fan', 'base', 'similar', 'kevin', 'harts', 'pineapples', 'gone', 'learn', 'today', 'bernie', 'macs', 'milk', 'cookiesbut', 'part', 'kind', 'fell', 'flati', 'also', 'think', 'isnt', 'artist', 'takes', 'criticism', 'well', 'even', 'well', 'meaning', 'sense', 'good', 'doesnt', 'like', 'live', 'please', 'fans', 'shes', 'authentically', 'however', 'everyones', 'hater', 'future', 'specials', 'fall', 'flat', 'like', 'shes', 'gonna', 'reach', 'ultimate', 'potential', 'think', 'especially', 'hard', 'semipolitical', 'special', 'like', 'separate', 'haters', 'fans', 'werent', 'feeling', 'might', 'easy', 'say', 'oh', 'got', 'low', 'ratings', 'cause', 'white', 'people', 'hating', 'cause', 'wasnt', 'politically', 'correctand', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'definitely', 'lot', 'people', 'mostly', 'white', 'mad', 'special', 'wasnt', 'made', 'please', 'themdespite', 'fact', 'told', 'yall', 'special', 'started', 'fact', 'sharing', 'legitimate', 'real', 'aspects', 'experience', 'black', 'woman', 'america', 'doesnt', 'mean', 'thinks', 'white', 'people', 'bad', 'means', 'black', 'people', 'black', 'women', 'encounter', 'lot', 'white', 'people', 'micro', 'aggressions', 'throughout', 'lives', 'annoyinghurtful', 'funnyhowever', 'also', 'lot', 'people', 'like', 'fellow', 'black', 'woman', 'btw', 'legitimately', 'criticizing', 'writingpacingdelivery', 'aspects', 'special', 'hoping', 'gets', 'betterwho', 'also', 'think', 'shell', 'probably', 'write', 'hating', 'getting']"

1945,7752142,"Todd Glass is a comedian whose name is suspended marginally, and maybe not even on a conscious level, above the wash of total media input experienced over the last 37 years of existence. He's a talent from the early 2000's, maybe even the 90's; a youtube video from the past, or maybe a special you saw that one time late at night on old school comedy central. In short, he's an answer to a trivia question you wouldn't be able to actively recall if your life depended on it. Well, let me tell you, this special is his magnum opus. Undeniably funny, truly laugh out loud funny to a man who doesn't find too much funny these days. His delivery here is completely transformed; it's like a free thinking exercise. Erratic and constant, coherent narrative peppered with fragmented thoughts on passing interests and observations, all done while simultaneously piloting a backing band like he's Sinatra on the Las Vegas strip. Cool and in control. It's a masterclass on comedic writing and performance. There are even insightful moments, messages I found truly touching, expressed in such a genuine way to the audience, and then BAM! back to the material, the people are here for the jokes. We got jokes for you ladies and gentlemen! Despite concealment by a very loose and freewheeling delivery, it's still clear that this is meticulously hand-crafted fruit from a lifetime's work as an on-the-road, blood, sweat, and tears, comedian.

But Sebastian is somewhat uneasy in this, and you can tell he thinks a lot about the well-being of other people. Jerry doesn't really put him at ease and you can tell he's not a genuinely nice person. When the other person has a big personality for example, the episode does work. But in this one, Sebastian doesn't really let loose partly because the way Jerry speaks to him, although it gets better at the end.Jerry just treat everyone differently.

1957,0246645,"It was only coincidence that I was watching this special the day after George Carlin died recently. I know there is a sudden rush now to see all his old stuff as if he was a relative who we never spent enough time with but for me it was just something that I had recorded and had taken my time getting round to. I'm not a massive fan of Carlin but I have seen parts of his career that I have thought were really smart, insightful and funny.Although it has its moments and plenty of energy, You Are All Diseased is not among his better word, indeed it is surprisingly weak. The only other review on this site that has pointed this out has been roundly slated via the ""useful"" voting system and I imagine it will be worse now due to talking ill of the dead but it is hard to avoid seeing the show for what it mostly is. And what that is is an angry rant that is surprisingly weak in validity and humour. I'm all for angry comedy and I think the more acerbic the better but I need to be able to understand the point being made behind it, even if the routine ends up in extreme examples, if it is built on a good point then it works.Here though too many of Carlin's rants are built on unreasonable points from the very start and it takes away from how interesting it is to listen to. It begins at the beginning with a rant against hygiene. In that he rails against the basic hygiene habits everyone should have and it risks losing him the viewer as one starts to think ""well, hang on a minute"" about what is being said. Here and there he makes really good points in his angry rant but too much of it seems to be anger for anger's sake with illogical arguments and (in some cases) hypocrisy, as the basis. What is worse is that a lot of the humour seems dependant wholly on swearing, shock value and energy to carry it. Of course this is not wholly a criticism because he does work this angle really well and the crowd do love him for it, just for me I was laughing at this and I didn't think the crowd were so much as they were ""reacting"" to the delivery.Carlin may be gone but he has left behind him some very work from his career; problem here is that I don't consider You Are All Diseased is among it.

I finally recorded this comedy special and I happily continue to view it frequently. I must say that before I go into detail, that George Carlin is by far the best comedian of all time, simply because of his caustic style he goes for the jugular. Carlin is not mellowing with age. In this 60-minute rant, the 61-year-old comic brimming with vim and vinegar, Carlin sniped at everything you can name airport security, germs, cigars, angels, Harley Davidson, House of Blues, Language, Guy Stuff, Parents, TV., Names, and of course God and Religion and even children. Carlin says it best when America's leading industry is the quality and manufacture of bullshit USDA Prime Cut! I think Carlin can best be described as a risk taker who tells the truth, but keeps the cynical people such as myself happy. I also suggest you purchase the cassette tape of this comedy special to listen to as you drive your car! Finally all I can say is that I'm glad Carlin is holding on to his night job.

That would be more than Harry Connick Jr. Or the band Chicago drew when they appeared earlier this season. For this Radio City Music Hall show, Mulaney riffed on the horrors of elementary school assemblies, how his college experience was like a four year game show, and how he's feeling gross at the age of thirty five. It's interesting he focused on that age, because if you catch some movies form the Forties and Fifties, like Gregory Peck's ""The Gunfighter"", you'll sometimes hear a character lament about being over the hill at thirty five.

1997,8271714,"I got to see John Mulaney live during his Kid Gorgeous tour in 2018 and it was probably the funniest live stand up show I've ever been to. Stand Up Comedy is incredibly hit or miss for me. I either love someone's act or I don't. No in between. He's great because he's got an edge but he's not offensive. He's personal but willing to take on the man. And best of all, he's actually funny. He has such an amazing way with words and humor. His best material is when he's talking about his personal life and his bizarre encounters with wacky, almost literally like, characters. He doesn't talk down to people and he's a master of self deprecating humor. It's incredible how far this man has come in recent years after only 4 specials. Kid Gorgeous is hilarious, heartfelt and smart. His stories about his parents and childhood are great and his brilliant metaphor for the current ""presidential"" administration is the best I have heard and likely ever will. It's smart but not obvious and mean spirited. He's just being honest with himself and how he feels (I happened to agree). I'd rather a comedian be honest about how they feel then just try to shock and offend people for the sake of it. That's why Mulaney and others like Carlin and Pryor are so great. They were honest with their feelings. They laid it all out for us to see. And I feel that if Mulaney keeps this up, he will one day be among the greats, if he isn't already. It's a toss up for me as to which of his specials is the best. I'm pretty partial to The Comeback Kid Myself, But this may be a very close second.

Instead of connecting with you as a person, I felt like my intelligence was insulted. It's so carefully inoffensive that it offends, so over- processed that it feels wooden and empty.

2022,10521638,"All I've known about Whitney Cummings was her involvement in that atrocious ""2 Broke Girls"" show, where virtually every single joke was set up in the most torturous, unnatural way and delivered a punchline that wasn't even remotely worth the terrible writing necessary to set it up. But her name caught my eye on Netflix, so I decided to check out what her standup was like.On the whole, it was much more natural than her comic writing in the scripted comedy. It flowed fairly well, and was actually pretty funny sometimes. I had no real complaints about her standup, and while the whole men and women, women and men, ain't it funny? sort of comedy isn't exactly blazing new comic trails, I enjoyed it. As a guy, I found it funny even if I didn't necessarily relate to a large chunk of it because my life experiences haven't been the same. being able to find universal strands of humor is really what comedy should aspire too, after all. My only problem was that after 20 minutes or so, I was just desperately looking for some variety of topic and theme. So I turned it off and came back the next day. I lasted another 20 minutes before deciding to take a break and finish it the next day. Even though, as I said, I generally enjoyed her comedy and found her reasonably funny, it's not really a good thing that someone needs three days to get through an hour-long special.I'll check out some of her other stuff when I get a chance, just to see if the narrow scope of her comedy routine is typical or just a fluke.",0,,ur4404145,14 December 2019,0,,139,115,5.83453237410072,0.8273381294964028,"('comedy', 5)('funny', 4)('even', 3)('set', 2)('writing', 2)('check', 2)('standup', 2)('whole', 2)('comic', 2)('men', 2)","['ive', 'known', 'whitney', 'cummings', 'involvement', 'atrocious', 'broke', 'girls', 'show', 'virtually', 'every', 'single', 'joke', 'set', 'torturous', 'unnatural', 'way', 'delivered', 'punchline', 'wasnt', 'even', 'remotely', 'worth', 'terrible', 'writing', 'necessary', 'set', 'name', 'caught', 'eye', 'netflix', 'decided', 'check', 'standup', 'likeon', 'whole', 'much', 'natural', 'comic', 'writing', 'scripted', 'comedy', 'flowed', 'fairly', 'well', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'real', 'complaints', 'standup', 'whole', 'men', 'women', 'women', 'men', 'aint', 'funny', 'sort', 'comedy', 'isnt', 'exactly', 'blazing', 'new', 'comic', 'trails', 'enjoyed', 'guy', 'found', 'funny', 'even', 'didnt', 'necessarily', 'relate', 'large', 'chunk', 'life', 'experiences', 'havent', 'able', 'find', 'universal', 'strands', 'humor', 'really', 'comedy', 'aspire', 'problem', 'minutes', 'desperately', 'looking', 'variety', 'topic', 'theme', 'turned', 'came', 'back', 'next', 'day', 'lasted', 'another', 'minutes', 'deciding', 'take', 'break', 'finish', 'next', 'day', 'even', 'though', 'said', 'generally', 'enjoyed', 'comedy', 'found', 'reasonably', 'funny', 'really', 'good', 'thing', 'someone', 'needs', 'three', 'days', 'get', 'hourlong', 'specialill', 'check', 'stuff', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'narrow', 'scope', 'comedy', 'routine', 'typical', 'fluke']"

2034,2534670,"Stewart Lee's life is now mostly driving around and looking after kids so his frame of cultural references has dramatically shrunk and at the same time his ability to compete with the more modern stand-up style of the Mock the Week regulars and the like, with their stadium shows and sound-bite gags. Of course it is made even harder for him when a third of the Sheffield audience have clearly never seen him before but heard good things and were perhaps not prepared for his rather unique style of delivery.I like Stewart Lee and recently I watched the 41st Best Stand-Up show and enjoyed it a lot and soon after got this one. The approach is the same in Carpet Remnant World because Lee gives a comedy show while also pushing against the norms of the stand-up circuit whether it be the delivery and jokes of the big names who pack stadiums, or the audience who struggle unless (in his perception) they are given what they are used to and don't have to do anything themselves. Previously he has walked that lined really well and there are times in this show where he gets it right – pushing back against his craft and his audience but not so much that he pushes away, just challenges. However in this show I think he does it too often, for too long and with almost too much effort to attack. It isn't helped by the feeling that the show is too long – and it does feel it.This sort of hurts the material more than it should because he is joking that the audience isn't with him and that the material isn't working at the same time as the audience are unsure and some of the material is falling flat. Despite this this, Lee himself is still funny even if some of his morbid moments make him seem like Jack Dee more than he would like I'd guess. Lee's greatest skill is to deliver a great comedy show while also deconstructing it, you and the craft while you enjoy it – here he does a bit too much of the latter and is weaker than normal on the former – although I'd still watch this again and again over the generic big Christmas DVD's from ""proper"" stand-ups selling out Wembley Arena.",0,,ur1002035,2 January 2014,0,,181,146,5.679558011049724,0.8066298342541437,"('show', 6)('audience', 5)('like', 4)('standup', 3)('lee', 3)('much', 3)('isnt', 3)('material', 3)('stewart', 2)('lees', 2)","['stewart', 'lees', 'life', 'mostly', 'driving', 'around', 'looking', 'kids', 'frame', 'cultural', 'references', 'dramatically', 'shrunk', 'time', 'ability', 'compete', 'modern', 'standup', 'style', 'mock', 'week', 'regulars', 'like', 'stadium', 'shows', 'soundbite', 'gags', 'course', 'made', 'even', 'harder', 'third', 'sheffield', 'audience', 'clearly', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'perhaps', 'prepared', 'rather', 'unique', 'style', 'deliveryi', 'like', 'stewart', 'lee', 'recently', 'watched', 'best', 'standup', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'soon', 'got', 'one', 'approach', 'carpet', 'remnant', 'world', 'lee', 'gives', 'comedy', 'show', 'also', 'pushing', 'norms', 'standup', 'circuit', 'whether', 'delivery', 'jokes', 'big', 'names', 'pack', 'stadiums', 'audience', 'struggle', 'unless', 'perception', 'given', 'used', 'dont', 'anything', 'previously', 'walked', 'lined', 'really', 'well', 'times', 'show', 'gets', 'right', 'pushing', 'back', 'craft', 'audience', 'much', 'pushes', 'away', 'challenges', 'however', 'show', 'think', 'often', 'long', 'almost', 'much', 'effort', 'attack', 'isnt', 'helped', 'feeling', 'show', 'long', 'feel', 'itthis', 'sort', 'hurts', 'material', 'joking', 'audience', 'isnt', 'material', 'isnt', 'working', 'time', 'audience', 'unsure', 'material', 'falling', 'flat', 'despite', 'lee', 'still', 'funny', 'even', 'morbid', 'moments', 'make', 'seem', 'like', 'jack', 'dee', 'would', 'like', 'id', 'guess', 'lees', 'greatest', 'skill', 'deliver', 'great', 'comedy', 'show', 'also', 'deconstructing', 'craft', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'much', 'latter', 'weaker', 'normal', 'former', 'although', 'id', 'still', 'watch', 'generic', 'big', 'christmas', 'dvds', 'proper', 'standups', 'selling', 'wembley', 'arena']"
2035,2534670,"The first time I saw Lee was back in 1985, before he got famous and everyone else got into him. He was then a promising young stand up.The second time I saw Lee, in 1996, he was was working as an apprentice fitter at Quik-fit and was responsible for replacing tyre-valve caps. He was rubbish at his job then and still is. He managed to put one valve on the end of my aerial and lost the other three. So too, in this video, he misplaces the focus of his foul temper and has a go at the audience for not understanding his jokes and not laughing and calling them 'stupid'.

2043,2346046,"When I used to sit on on auditions for HBO, we judged comics on two scales, material and delivery, and this system has held up over the years. If you watch a lot of sets from newcomers, you will see times when the material is better than the comic, and times when the comic is better than the material. When both are working in sync, you have something special. Occasionally, however, you find a comic not only with superb material and great delivery/timing, but someone who has put their imprint on the entire mixture, and created something so unique -- this is the test -- that you cannot imagine anyone else doing it, and getting away with it. Think of the wonderful, late, George Carlin, Think Lewis Black. With Amy Schumer we have a performer that meets this test. Quirky, kinky, idiosyncratic, by the final credits you cannot remember ever seeing anyone else quite like her. The show was great. The potential is great. And here is the kicker, you have to wonder what would happen if she lightened up on the sex humour (which works about 80% of the time, not too shabby) and took a chance doing ""pure"" comedy. I once caught an mp3 of her (not from this show) talking about taking a dog home for the weekend for a test drive, understanding that, if you bring it back, they will kill it.

I like some of the decisions he has made and I happen to think that he's infinitely smarter than Biden (although that's not a difficult level to achieve)....... but does that make me an idiot?No it just makes me a person with a different opinion!Jefferies can have some funny moments and he's got a lot of balls to get up and do what he does but he wears off very quickly and I wouldn't ever bother to go and see him in a show or search the streaming channels for another of his specials.You could learn a lot from Jim Davidson, he knows how to work a touchy issue into something funny .. maybe watch some of his stuff to improve your act.",0,,ur46485353,3 August 2020,0,,108,95,6.018518518518518,0.8796296296296297,"('funny', 4)('jim', 3)('hes', 3)('something', 2)('like', 2)('dont', 2)('get', 2)('think', 2)('lot', 2)('humour', 1)","['humour', 'anger', 'hard', 'funny', 'jim', 'jefferies', 'fails', 'succeeds', 'dragging', 'speciallook', 'jim', 'want', 'something', 'funny', 'politician', 'like', 'donald', 'trump', 'dont', 'turn', 'half', 'audience', 'telling', 'dumb', 'voting', 'much', 'right', 'many', 'reasons', 'vote', 'someone', 'elsetheres', 'motherlode', 'material', 'use', 'parody', 'personal', 'idiosyncrasies', 'dont', 'insult', 'anybody', 'get', 'laughsfor', 'example', 'think', 'hes', 'badly', 'educated', 'buffoon', 'crafty', 'cunning', 'businessman', 'like', 'decisions', 'made', 'happen', 'think', 'hes', 'infinitely', 'smarter', 'biden', 'although', 'thats', 'difficult', 'level', 'achieve', 'make', 'idiotno', 'makes', 'person', 'different', 'opinionjefferies', 'funny', 'moments', 'hes', 'got', 'lot', 'balls', 'get', 'wears', 'quickly', 'wouldnt', 'ever', 'bother', 'go', 'see', 'show', 'search', 'streaming', 'channels', 'another', 'specialsyou', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'jim', 'davidson', 'knows', 'work', 'touchy', 'issue', 'something', 'funny', 'maybe', 'watch', 'stuff', 'improve', 'act']"
2073,5849950,"The woe so tiresome shtick of claiming ""comedian"" while trashing half of America. Another comedian who capitalizes on capitalism by spewing every left wing talking point. Tiresome and old. Boring. Not fresh. Check box, check box, check box. He hit them all before I walked away.""Oh he's so CLEVER!"" the left will say while clapping like seals. Feed me more division and hate! they exclaim.I'm not particularly left or right in my views, a mix of both, nor particularly religious, but this show ended up being turned off after the comedian who preaches (and I do not use that term lightly) but decides to preach to us on ""love not hate"", guns, religion, Trump, Fox News, abortion, you name it. Every leftist's talking point he could squeeze into an act before it was turned off in our home. Talk about swimming downstream. The easiest route any ""entertainer"" could make. A man who preaches about his atheism, and how religion kills, whilst more people are killed in the US on the streets by atheists than no other (just see Chicago gangs, LA gangs, Baltimore, etc). A man who preaches about love overcoming hate, while spewing hate and dividing further. Hypocrisy on an epic scale from Jefferies. He has to throw in ""Fox"" just to get the seals clapping. And takes Trump's words out of context and lies to further divide our country.What an odd show. There was a time when real comedians would poke fun at everyone, left right center. It didn't matter. Perhaps Jefferies is driven by the exact fear that he portends Trump to project? Fear of no audience because it is his fear-mongering and hate and division that drives his audience to his liberal doors. There is so much material on Hillary, for example, or Libertarians, but his fear keeps him far from that subject. I call cowardice and greed on this. Pick a side, make money. What a shame. Another so-called hypocrite comedian charlatan. I'm pretty sure Christians, Jews, and Buddhists or whoever would give him a pass, because after all they truly preach love, don't they?The hypocrite, fear spreading comedian? No thanks.

It doesn't matter if portrayed events are real. We get rid of our frustrations, for lack of courage to be dicks in real life, through his stories. I give him that and hope he stays on the scene for a very long time. The problem with Jim is that he thinks he can be smart too. He thinks his politics and his scientism (yes, it's scientism) are valid. Just like many actors. He then creates fake stories to make his views real and valid. It's one thing to make up an entertaining story and a completely different matter when a political agenda is wrapped in it. This is pure demagogy. Why is he doing this? Cause he is just human, like you and me. He needs to believe things and he needs to convince others that his beliefs are the truth.

I love the differences pointed out between the word ""midgets"" and the N-word...The inclusion of Amy Schumer was a bit odd, considering she has no lines whatsoever.

2094,3210258,"After seeing Bo Burnham's ""Words Words Words"" I became a bit hooked on his style and musical taste. And then seeing another person call this new special a ""masterpiece"", I had to see if he could pull it off again. My initial opinion is no.With a voice that sounds more like Weird Al every day, the show featured a large amount of pre-recorded material. While the bits surrounding that material was funny at times, it stretched on a bit long and really took away from the natural spontaneity of stand up comedy.Burnham has also become more obscene. While his misogyny is clearly ironic, he pushes the sexual humor to a new level. Funny? Yes. But also a sad thing, because he is smarter than this and going for a laugh with a sex joke is the easy way out.The ""God song"" (title unknown) was a high point, and he still has plenty of musical creativity in him.

2095,3210258,"Bo returns to the stage, and delivers on his multiple talents - playing instruments(mostly ""air"" ones) and comedy - musical(including making it largely out of sampled sounds), verbal and physical. He goes for wordplay, the clever, and the silly, with universal jokes, rather than ones that will date this.As usual, he prioritizes being consistently funny and challenging over having one specific focus - with that said, he does get rather introspective(such as the ""two halves of the brain"" bit), and one can tell that he has grown since he launched on the internet. Of course, this doesn't mean that he is unrecognizable, far from it. His brand and identity remain intact, and in-between, sometimes even in, the intellectual parts, he gets just as immature as we want him to.Awkwardness is embraced, not shied away from. That of himself, and some of the things that go into shaping a show like this - yes, he does go as meta and self-referential as usual(a child of YouTube, that much is clear). We can follow his line of thinking, and yet he throws curve-balls our way. Plain and simple, we never, for a second, know exactly what he's going to do next, and whenever he jumps tracks in his train of thought, the audience(including the live ones for the video recording of this) loves it. It is simply that carefully crafted.Among his material are social problems(with an indictment of himself and other artists, making this simultaneously the illness and the cure, the reason for needing, and the actual pursuing of, therapy), integrity, religion, sexuality, etc. At the time of writing this, the entire well-paced 60-minute presentation is up on, and thus endorsed by, his own channel, so legally free to watch.There is brutal and disturbing imagery in this.

2107,7026230,"With Patton Oswalt: Annihilation - aka, here's what life is like in 2017 - I'm not sure if I've seen a stand-up comedy special end on such a stark, philosophical note since Carlin's Jammin' in New York (which was, you know, about how to let go of the world itself). Oswalt's genius is taking us through such a horrible tale like becoming a widower - and, yes, one knows logically he's done this material in other clubs and venues, but not for a second do we doubt he's only barely holding himself together on stage as he tells us and the Chicago audience about telling his daughter her mother is dead - while still weaving in enough jokes that the line between a usual bit with set-up and payoff and simply... laying it all out for us, is blurred.It's also not *all* about the ""I'm-now-a-Widower"" state he's in, as he also riffs wonderfully on Trump (just enough that it doesn't get tired), a fight outside a triangle of bars that had an epic, DC/Marvel superhero event quality in the weirdest way possible (at least to how I saw it), and what happens if you want to pitch a G-rated kids movie but using porn descriptions. Hell, he does crowd work at one point - I have to think part of that was the conscious level of, 'well, how in god's name to I transition into ""my wife is dead"" material', but at the same time it feels like he's being doing it forever - and this is the first I can remember seeing him do it that didn't involve a heckler, and it's all in a warm, mocking spirit.There are a handful of times that I can think a joke didn't land *quite* as hard as Oswalt meant to, but I could care less; this is his most outstanding work since 2009, and the piece about the late Mrs Oswalt, Michelle McNamara, is among the great pieces I've ever seen in a stand-up special.

However for me his race-based material here (and there was a lot of it) is no different from the rest of his material in that it has hits and misses across it. This lack of consistency across the hour was a downer for me but the hits were just about often and strong enough to keep the show going. Chappelle himself runs the stage well and engages with his small audience like a pro. He is good at broaching whatever subject he sees fit to deal with, which is a good thing in a comedian rather than settling for comfort.

I mean that though in just the overall sense, that there are a couple of bits that aren't totally consistently funny (the 'Monkey' bit, the bit on the 15 year old kidnapped girl). Throughout, however, there are bits that really do make it known why Chappelle is where he's at today. For example, his take on why he can't smoke weed with black people anymore (and the pros and cons of smoking with white people) is gut-busting, or his take on the Michael Jackson case (last year this was filmed, by the way, which should be taken into perspective), or his lines on how he's dealing with his newfound fame (and what he'll do with a certain part of his privates).

2121,0424934,"There's another Chapelle show from DC a few years before that I prefer by a slight margin; this one he taped in Fillmore. Both shows are hit or miss, some jokes work for me, others not, the way it always is. More than jokes however, it's the base layer fabric that connects jokes that really interests me in stand up, how a narrator carries himself up and down a world he conjures, all that imperceptible presence - a self - that holds everything together to which the jokes are really tips of the iceberg; mannerisms, posture, air, pauses of empty space, all these no less a part of 'joking'.Jokes are years in the making in most cases because they're working on all those things; but so is the self, the narrator, it's the work in progress of learning to be the person you are, growing (or not) in how you inhabit yourself. Louis CK, who is my favorite, is a pleasure to watch for this, he can inhabit himself without compunctions; Louis channels being a slob in body and behavior but he's not a slob in mind.So he struck me as smoother in DC, or maybe it was that the distance between the twenty-something guy on stage and the twenty-something guy who lives in his jokes felt much closer, like he had just drove off from the streets he depicts and landed on that stage. He's more of a professional here.

2123,0424934,"Fresh from taping season 2 of Chappelle's Show, which would sadly turn out to be his last full season, Dave Chappelle brings the fire and magnetism that helped make him a superstar. For his second hour-long special, Chappelle has decided to go to The Fillmore in San Francisco, a nearly 100-year-old venue. Right away we're walked through the history of the place. Lenny Bruce played there. Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, George Carlin, and Paul Mooney played there. This of course adds an air of importance to the set, a kind of ""big game"" atmosphere. What he ends up bringing, however, is a fairly juvenile performance, with misguided bits on Native Americans or having sex with monkeys, and a really questionable riff on Michael Jackson's molestation allegations including openly questioning the motivations of the child at the center of the the scandal and then later inexplicably criticizing a captive Elizabeth Smart for not doing enough to escape. When he's not busy blaming victims, he does have some pointed criticisms for America's founding fathers and insights into celebrity add some substance to the show, but unfortunately aren't quite enough to raise it to the lofty expectations set with the opening. Thankfully Chappelle has never been a comedian that relied too heavily on strong writing when it came to his stand-up, often being able to sell middle-of-the-road material with charisma and charm. He's able to do that to an extent with this, but there's only so far that carries you. After his first special, people across the world excitedly called their friends with bad interpretations of his gags that they were bubbling over to share.

2131,0439784,"Starting out at the Houses of Parliament, Ricky Gervais shows how politics are all around us  even demonstrating on a passing disabled man. This trend continues once he is onstage and he covers all sorts of topics with a vague connection to politics and daily life. The connections are perhaps a little thin but Gervais certainly says the stuff that the rest of us are either too scared to say or just have the decency not to even think of saying.And that is perhaps the main problem with this show  the material doesn't really have a flow to it because mostly Gervais is just out to shock and the laughs come mainly from the surprise of hearing what he has said rather than it being actually that clever or witty. Before he was famous for The Office, this was what Gervais did  a small section in the 11 o'clock show where he used to come on and be politically incorrect. On this show it worked because it was such a small part of the show and that was all he had to do. When he did The Office he scaled back the political incorrect content and made it into a person that many of us know and managed to be both funny and also painfully human. However for the majority of this film there is no real connection with character or reality; instead Gervais takes everything to extremes and, by doing so, he is quite funny but it doesn't really stay with you.I laughed quite a bit during it but it isn't that clever or witty. The bits I did think were good were the clips in between where his warm-up Robin Ince and Gervais talk about their weird relationship. That was actually funny and interesting because it was clever and involved characters that were slightly exaggerated but still possible.

The majority of the jokes are based on this theme, of course he leaves room to delve into other subjects. Gervais started his career playing versions of himself and characters that are perceived as annoying bastards, he does continue this persona on stage, and it works fantastically well, this is a reasonably funny show.

Threads involving Humpty Dumpty, the drought in Africa and the holocaust (I told you it's not for everyone!) are particular highlights. Gervais is great because he goes that extra mile that most comedians wouldn't dare tread on. From the moment it starts, with a hilarious sequence involving Ricky and an Egyptian gay man in a wheel chair (he's not gay really), you know you're going to be in for a stand up show that is likely to offend, and offend it does.

This is a pretty good show that on the whole is pretty darned funny with weird and wonderful perspectives brought down by Mr Gervais himself, who seems in his element here walking around and talking about some of the ills in our society.My main gripe with the show was its length. It came in at 70-odd minutes long, and while that in itself is short, it was further compounded by the fact that Ricky Gervais kept walking back and fourth for water, or notes, etc. Which leads to the second gripe of the show, which is the fact that while this was stand up comedy the show seemed incredibly...tame. I don't mean the jokes were bad, but the show seemed very structured and prepared so at times it seemed almost like a comic lecture rather than a stand up like Billy Connoly, Robin Williams or Ross Noble who will go off on tangents and keep the atmosphere loose.I must admit though that some of the material was very good and there is no doubt that Ricky Gervais is a clever man.

However, this was criminally unfunny ( and also very short too ). There are a handful of occasions when Gervais manages to raise a smile but that is about it and he is just not a good stand-up comedian. The audience in the theatre also do not seem to be erupting into hysterical laughter through the performance. His routine although nominally called ""Politics"" is about anything that he regards as remotely funny, but he largely relies on talking about old friends anecdotes, leaflets and nursery rhymes. Oh yes and somebody called him ""Brent"" - wow isn't that...funny. If you compare this to the output of comics like Dave Gorman, Bill Bailey or Eddie Izzard you will see that this just does not measure up. It appears that at the moment there are people who would pay to watch Ricky Gervais drinking a glass of water or having a snooze and still think it was amazing.

His humour seems totally to rely on the shock value of being non pc  so the comparison with Jim Davidson in a previous review is totally warranted.

2148,5087554,"Hadn't heard of Anthony Jeselnik before watching, and really wasn't a fan of this special.I didn't like the first 2/3s because the jokes were so repetitive. He'd say something shocking, string the audience along for a bit, and then say a concluding statement that was slightly more shocking. There was very little by way of structure or flow; it was really choppy and dull. He'd try to give the illusion that things were spontaneous by asking the audience very basic questions, but would follow the answers up with further jokes that were barely relevant.He changes things up in the final 1/3, but that material didn't really work for me either. I might be alone or in the minority, but if you want to make fun of people who say ""thoughts and prayers"" (yes, please do make fun of that attitude; it's less prevalent now but I remember when it was much more common), then make fun of those people. The jokes he referenced about the cinema shooting and the Boston Marathon bombing weren't really making fun of those sorts of attention-craving people, or at least I'd understand people not seeing the connection. I mean if I'd read those tweeted jokes out of context, I'd find them pretty tasteless in all honesty.As for the Shark Party thing... I'd never heard of it but it did annoy me. If the victim had been someone who'd murdered sharks, go ahead, make fun of him. But it feels misguided to make fun of this man's horrible death if he hadn't been part of the problem. Him being killed by a shark isn't some kind of ironic retribution, at least not in my opinion. If you want to make fun of people who murder sharks by the million, then aim the comedy elsewhere.As a somewhat relevant sidenote, I watched a Youtube video today where someone made fun of a guy who made a public Facebook post, denying the severity of a certain virus in April and saying it was overhyped by the media, yet died of it sometime in July. That's dark too, but it can be argued that that deceased individual deserves mockery. At least there's karma; a sense of him being brought down in a darkly hilarious way.I think overall that's my problem with this special, particularly the final 20 minutes. Punch up and punch up hard, and the cruder and more extreme to the people who deserve it, the funnier that stuff can be. There's similarly crass and brash standup comedy out there that I have enjoyed. But I don't really like where Jeselnik targets his jokes, at least not the ones he references near the end of this special. He may have good intentions, or he may have awful intentions and simply have used this special to try and explain that he had some greater purpose or some higher target beyond the victims.I don't know, maybe I'm just not a fan. Despite not enjoying it, I'm glad I watched it, because it's made me think more about what I find funny and why, but the humour in this just really wasn't for me. If I've missed the point, or overlooked some detail, I apologise.

Even though you know he's going to say the most terrible thing possible, he somehow manages to surprise you. His demeanor also translates well with his jokes because he's one of those people that you can't really tell when they're being sarcastic or not because he says everything with a straight face. And he's fully aware that he makes politically incorrect jokes. He comments about how society is always super sensitive about one thing at a time, and he exploits the hell out of that. Seriously, it's crazy how much he gets away with here and it's kind of refreshing to see that Netflix (and pretty much everyone that allows him to continue doing shows) can actually appreciate and promote dark humor.

2161,5087554,"I would say the first 40 minutes is an ordinary stand-up comedy, but the last 20 minutes is pretty deep and strong.Generally, i myself have always had deep doubts about political correctness, seeing it as an ideological forbidden zone more than a sort of understandable social pressure with good intentions. Because I always believe that even our most cherished and most sensitive values need to be challenged from time to time. If not, even if this kind of political correctness is correct indeed, it is as John Stuart Mill said: ""Truth, thus held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunciate a truth.""And if even comedians are not allowed to implement the challenge, then who else can?",0,,ur24103492,1 August 2021,0,,63,55,6.714285714285714,0.873015873015873,"('even', 3)('minutes', 2)('deep', 2)('always', 2)('political', 2)('correctness', 2)('time', 2)('would', 1)('say', 1)('first', 1)","['would', 'say', 'first', 'minutes', 'ordinary', 'standup', 'comedy', 'last', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'deep', 'stronggenerally', 'always', 'deep', 'doubts', 'political', 'correctness', 'seeing', 'ideological', 'forbidden', 'zone', 'sort', 'understandable', 'social', 'pressure', 'good', 'intentions', 'always', 'believe', 'even', 'cherished', 'sensitive', 'values', 'need', 'challenged', 'time', 'time', 'even', 'kind', 'political', 'correctness', 'correct', 'indeed', 'john', 'stuart', 'mill', 'said', 'truth', 'thus', 'held', 'one', 'superstition', 'accidentally', 'clinging', 'words', 'enunciate', 'truthand', 'even', 'comedians', 'allowed', 'implement', 'challenge', 'else']"

2163,5087554,"I did not like this stand up comedy. I had to cut it off after the child molestation and child harming jokes. I mustered up the nerve to continue watching after he joked about the baby in the hot car in Cali. Then there was the child molestation/child sex offender jokes I disagreed with. I am sure he is not a terrible guy and may have looked at his jokes from a different point of view but from my point of view, and being a Victim's Advocate for Sexual Assaults, I find this very inappropriate even for adults. I would edit this stand up comedy, as I find it offensive and harmful in nature. With all the sexual assault cases being Brought up in Hollywood (and they are just as important now than ever) this is not the show that should be representing anyone right now. This is the type of things that are allowed because it comes from a man, yet had this been a female comedian with these same jokes, this show would have not even made it to the TV or any major network, but because he is a male, he can get. pass. This is unacceptable and VERY disgraceful comedy.

2164,5087554,"This was one of the funniest yet crudest comedy shows I have ever seen. Anthony Jeselnik even warns you about how vulgar he is so don't you complain about all the dead baby jokes and mocking tragedies such as the Boston Bombing, the 911 terrorist attacks and Eric Clapton's son. You will cringe, awkward laugh and be angry all at the same time. I think the best part of the show was seeing the audience reactions which is why they show the audience so much. Watching the men laugh at a sexist joke and the women just sit there with annoyed looks on their faces is one of the most hilarious things ever. The one thing I love a lot in the show other than the audience reactions is Anthony's plot twist humor. He always starts telling a joke, then you THINK you know what he is going to say next but then he switches the form on you which completely get you off guard which makes me laugh a ton.All in all, great performance by Anthony.
